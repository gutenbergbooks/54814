<h2 class="nobreak">A FIRST WORD TO READERS</h2>
</div>

<p>Many requests from parents for a simple method
of training children to think and remember have
prompted this series of books on "Mind Training for
Children."</p>

<p>Play is the child's great objective and this is capitalized
in the methods used in presenting this subject.
There are over fifty interesting games and as
many exercises, all of which are based upon scientific
principles. These will not only interest and
amuse the children, but will result in the development
of their senses and faculties. This will lead
naturally to the improvement of the memory.</p>

<p>In the last book all this advancement is applied to
the child's studies and school problems. Parents
should read these books and use the ideas according
to the ages of the children. Older children can
read and apply the principles for themselves, but
should be encouraged and guided by the parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Here is a great boon to mothers who need assistance
in entertaining the children in the house or out
of doors. For rainy days and children's parties
there is a never-ending source of pleasure and continual
profit in these Mind Training Games.</p>

<p>No equipment is required. All games and exercises
are so planned that they are easily made of materials
already in the home. The making of the
games will interest the children for hours.</p>

<p>Sense training is fundamental to profitable education.</p>

<p>Memory is the storehouse of all knowledge&mdash;see
that your child has a good one.</p>

<p>You can give your children a wonderful advantage
by playing these games with them. They have
the indorsement of educators. They are scientific,
but simple and "lots of fun."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TRAINING THE SENSES</h2>
</div>

<p>All through life you are accumulating knowledge,
and storing it away for future usefulness. This
knowledge becomes yours through one process,
which is a series of impressions carried to your brain
by the nerves connecting it with the sense organs of
your body.</p>

<p>The future value of this knowledge will depend
largely upon the accuracy of the first sense impression.
If the sense impression is dim and indefinite
the resulting knowledge will be uncertain and useless.
If the sense impression is inaccurate the resulting
knowledge will be an error and cause a mistake
in judgment. The senses are the tools, by the
use of which the mind accumulates the knowledge
which it uses in memory, thought, judgment, imagination,
and all the mental operations.</p>

<p>Professor W. Prior says: "The foundation of all
mental development is the activity of the senses."</p>

<p>The first step in mental growth is the making of
impressions on the brain by the senses. The senses
are the instruments by the use of which all knowledge
is acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Sense training is the logical beginning of all
Education.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>You give your child an education to help him to
succeed in life. First give him sharp tools&mdash;keen
senses&mdash;that he may get the best results from the
time spent in study.</p>

<p>An understanding of the proper use of the senses
will enable you to make these impressions lasting&mdash;instead
of fleeting.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Lack of ability to properly use the senses is a
handicap in life and a subtle foe to success.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>In the beginning all the brain does is to store the
simple sense impressions. The baby sees his mother
many times before he recognizes her. The eye nerve
carries to the brain the picture of the mother's face
and stores it there. Soon the brain perceives the
similarity and the child recognizes her. The fact
that in some way the brain retains the first, second,
third, etc., impressions becomes the foundation of
recognition.</p>

<p>If the sense nerve failed to carry the image of the
face there would be no comparison and no recognition.
Without sense impression there can be no
knowledge. Imperfect sense impressions can only
result in imperfect knowledge.</p>

<p>Each set of sense nerves carries its impressions to
a different area of the brain. Each set has a distinct
and localized memory. The ear memory is the auditory
memory. There is the gustatory memory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
taste; the olfactory memory of smell, and the tactual
memory of touch.</p>

<p>The visual memory is the most accurate and lasting.
The nerves connecting the eyes with the brain
are many times larger than those of the other sense
organs. Psychological tests have also proven the
eye to be the most accurate of all the senses. Next
to the eye comes the ear in both strength and
exactness.</p>


<h3>Sense Training Games</h3>

<p>The training of the senses, important and necessary
as it is, can be accomplished in a most entertaining
and pleasant manner. The playing of games,
so necessary in the life of children, can in most cases
be used as the agency to gain this result.</p>


<h3>Game of Hide the Watch</h3>

<p>You can entertain your children for an hour with
this game and at the same time, even without their
knowledge, be training one of their most important
senses.</p>

<p>Go into a quiet room and hide a watch where it
will be out of sight but in a place where the ticking
will be plainly audible. If the children are small it
will be well to start with a small clock, or a watch
which ticks loudly. Now let the children come into
the room and, standing perfectly still, try to locate
the watch by hearing it tick. Let them move around,
but very quietly, so as not to disturb the others; or
let all move at one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>When one of them has located the watch allow
that child to remain and assist you in hiding it for
the others. A record can be kept to see who finds
the watch the most often. One child must not be
allowed to move noisily, or in any way disturb the
efforts of the others. See to it that they use their
ears and not their eyes; it will even be well to blindfold
them.</p>


<h3>Results of Sense Training</h3>

<p>That the senses can be trained every one will at
once admit. The world is full of examples, as the
Indian savage with his keen sight and hearing. You
may think this a natural born ability but there are
many examples to prove the contrary. The American
scouts, some of whom have gone into the Indian
country when they were grown men, have become
almost as proficient as the Indians themselves.</p>

<p>This fact of the unusual ability of the Indian is
true today as well as in the story periods of the past.
On a recent camping and canoeing trip through the
lakes of Canada, it was a common occurrence for
the Indian guide to say, "Washkeesh," meaning deer.
No one in the party could see the animal, but the
Indian would point out the exact spot, and as the
party canoed silently along the shores the deer would
soon become visible to all.</p>

<p>This training of the Indian was brought about
largely by necessity. It was required for the preservation
of his life. The same is true of the white
man who has gone into the Indian's country. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
were all driven by the same necessity we would have
the same keenly developed senses.</p>

<p>Prof. Magnusson says: "There is affecting our
senses what may be called the disease of civilization.
Civilized man does not have to use his senses." Let
the realization of the importance of the ability spur
you to conscious effort to secure this result for your
children. It can be done by playing the games which
are to follow&mdash;it is of great value.</p>

<p>Prof. Gates has demonstrated that by exercising
one of the senses we actually build up brain matter.
A child who is helped to cultivate the sense of sight
will not only make more brain cells in the visual
areas but will also make more brain generally; for
the sense of sight correlates with all other areas of
the brain. This is a result well worth striving for.</p>

<p>There are many other examples in the different
trades of today. The Tea and Wine tasters have a
very fine sense of taste and smell. The jeweler has
a well developed sense of hearing so that he can
detect irregularities in the ticking of a clock that
are imperceptible to most of us. Makers of telescope
lenses complete the smoothing of the surface by
rubbing them with the fingers, being able in this
way to detect the slightest roughness. The blind
have a very fine sense of feeling and hearing. Deaf
people often have a keen sense of sight.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Necessity and Desire are the parents of all
progress and development.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> will notice that in all of these cases there
are these two impelling motives which have caused
this great improvement. Create in the child the desire
to be unusual in this regard. Show him that
the highest success of life necessitates this development.
Also that in every case it comes as the result
of individual effort. The one possessing this unusual
capacity acquired it only as the result of his
own continued practice. The senses cannot be developed
in a day. They CAN be developed, however,
if you will make any reasonable effort.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>The child will attach most value to that which
gives him the greatest pleasure.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a fact which you must keep in mind
throughout all your efforts in child training. Whenever
possible make the exercises into games and
make them interesting. Do not work so long with
one idea that it becomes tiresome or tedious to the
child. Add anything that suggests itself to you that
will give variety. When the child seems to be losing
interest or paying only partial attention, vary the
game or change to some other. In all the exercises
it is helpful to note the results and keep careful
watch of the progress made. Have competitive trials
and championship records; always keep some incentive
for further effort before him.</p>


<h3>Encourage Individualism</h3>

<p>Each child should be a rule unto himself. Do not
encourage or strive for uniformity of desire or result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in your children. Let them reveal those distinctive
characteristics with which they are endowed and
then encourage and assist them in their development.</p>

<p>A child will excel in some things and possibly be
deficient in others. He will naturally wish to play
most often that game in which he does best. Do not
deny this game, but use it as a reward, when the
child does well the thing he most needs. Use the
promise to play it as an inducement to get him to
do the more necessary or difficult exercise first.</p>

<p>Even in cases where the children are old enough
to use these books themselves, parents should keep
an oversight of the games used, to see that all of
their senses, and especially the eye and the ear, are
developed.</p>

<p>An all around development is most necessary.
When parents join the game let it be an opportunity
to introduce and encourage the most needed exercises.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Training the senses will result in greater ability
in all mental operations throughout life.</b></p>

<p><b>A few moments' daily use of the games and
exercises in these books will attain the result.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>There is one principal instruction, that is&mdash;MAKE
AN EFFORT&mdash;TRY.</p>

<p>Then persist, try again, let failure spur you to
greater effort. Only he who continues to try, after
others have tried and given up, will win the prize of
success.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TO DEVELOP THE SENSE OF TOUCH</h2>
</div>

<p>The child should be taught to determine the degree
of smoothness, size, shape, quality (of cloth),
and many other things of value by touch. You can
give an experienced dry goods clerk a piece of cloth
and he can tell without looking at it what kind it is,
and about what grade. This is entirely a matter of
development upon the part of the clerk. When he
began this work he could not tell muslin from long-cloth.</p>

<p>Parents will get a good idea of what is going on
in the child's mind, and the training he is receiving
by watching the little fingers work in all these exercises
for the development of the sense of touch. Try
the exercises yourself and see what is required to do
them accurately. In this way you will be better able
to help the child. Washing the hands in tepid water
before the exercises of touch will increase the sensitiveness
of the fingers. Have the child touch lightly
with the pads at the ends of the fingers. Increase
the difficulty of the exercises as he progresses.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>&mdash;Blindfold the child and hand him
articles which are somewhat familiar and have him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
tell, by feeling, what they are. Have him describe
them. If a knife, what kind of a knife it is. If a
box, what kind of a box it is&mdash;about how long? how
wide? how high? If you ask the child to give these
estimates in inches after removing the blindfold
have him make the actual measurements. Have the
child describe the article, giving all the details possible,
and find any peculiarities or irregularities by
feeling.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>&mdash;Give the child an article with which he
is not familiar and have him describe it. See how
much he can learn by touch alone. Then let him
see if he can learn any more by sound, by knocking
the article against something to determine what it
is made of, whether solid or hollow, etc.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>&mdash;Give the child, while blindfolded, a
book which he has recently read and see if he can
identify it by the size, shape, thickness, and quality
of paper.</p>


<h3>The Game of the Button Bag</h3>

<p>From your button bag select a number of different
buttons, two of each kind. Let the child sort out the
pairs and thus become somewhat familiar with the
sizes and shapes. Then mix the buttons, blindfold
the child, and let him match the pairs entirely by
feeling. Have him lay them out in pairs as he
matches them. Then take off the blindfold and let
him see them just as he has matched them, and count
for himself how many are right and how many
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h3>Game of Matching Cards</h3>

<p>Take a piece of cardboard and cut it into many
shapes, as suggested by the illustration below. Make
two pieces of each figure exactly alike. Let the
child match them and see that there are two of each
kind. Then mix them, blindfold him and have him
pick out the pairs by feeling. There should be at
least 12 sets&mdash;more if desired.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<h3>Animal Cookies</h3>

<p>A similar game to the one above can be played
with a box of animal cookies. Pour the cookies out
on a large plate. Blindfold the children and let
them select pairs of animals or as many of a kind as
possible. Let them name the animals by feeling.</p>


<h3>Game of Insets</h3>

<p>The expensive Insets used by the Montessori
School can be satisfactorily made out of heavy cardboard
and accomplish the desired result. Take a
piece of cardboard of good thickness and draw on
it some of the figures illustrated above. After they
are cut out with a sharp knife, smooth the edges so
that they will fit easily into the places from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they came. The cardboard from which they are cut
may be fastened to another or tacked to a thin board.
The game is to blindfold the child, give him the cutouts
and by the sense of touch let him find the proper
hole and fit the piece into it. As the pieces are fitted
into their places they may be left there until the
board is filled. This exercise is a little more difficult
than most of the others. Encourage the child to
keep at it.</p>


<h3>The Game of the Rag Bag</h3>

<p>Cut a number of pieces of different kinds of cloth.
Show them to the child and have him feel of them
and become acquainted with the pieces so as to know
them by name. Blindfold him and give him one of
the pieces of cloth and have him tell by feeling what
kind it is. Put all the pieces in the rag bag (any
large bag will do). Blindfold the child again and
let him pick out the kind of cloth you name. See
how many he can get correctly. Have him choose
velvet, silk, satin, calico, muslin, broadcloth, etc.,
using all the common varieties of cloth. Children
need not be blindfolded if the bag is held so they
cannot see. Blindfolding increases the curiosity and
thus the interest in the games.</p>


<h3>The Game of Dry Goods Clerk</h3>

<p>Cut from the scraps in your rag bag two pieces
each of all the different kinds of cloth that can be
found there. Make the pieces about two by four
inches and have them all of one size and shape. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the child examine them and match them in pairs.
Have him feel of them and see that they all feel different.
Do not have more than two pieces of any
one kind of cloth. Pay no attention to color. Now
mix the pieces in a pile on the table, blindfold the
child and seat him in front of them. Have him match
the pieces by feeling and lay each aside. When finished,
have the child look at the pairs as matched,
counting for himself the points won.</p>


<h3>The Game of&mdash;Who Is It?</h3>

<p>Blindfold two or three children. Silently select
one of the others to be identified by the blindfolded
children by means of touch. Let the blindfolded
ones feel of the child&mdash;his hair, face, clothes and
shoes. In this way see which one will first be able
to name him. To win this game depends a great deal
on the child's observation of what the other children
are wearing. The game of Blind Man's Buff is
similar and good, but usually has a good deal of
sound to assist the one guessing.</p>


<h3>The Game of&mdash;Weighing</h3>

<p>Get a pair of scales and let the child weigh anything
he wishes. Let him learn to accurately judge
a pound, then to estimate the weight of an article
before placing it upon the scales. Teach the child
comparative weights by lifting articles and determining
which is the heavier. Encourage him to make
a pair of balances with which he can balance one
object against the other after he has compared them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by holding one in each hand. Many variations can
be easily made of these ideas, to help the child to
become accurate in estimating weights. All practice
will be more interesting if there is a record made,
and the spirit of competition is introduced.</p>


<h3>Measuring</h3>

<p>Give the child a measure&mdash;quart or pint&mdash;and let
him learn to estimate the capacity of the different
utensils of the kitchen. He should in this manner
become able to judge accurately the contents of different
containers. The child should learn to estimate
in pecks, bushels, etc. This is good exercise
and a valuable ability for later life.</p>

<p>Let the games given here suggest new ones to be
used; any factor which will vary or add to the game
is valuable. Keep always in mind the fact that the
highest usefulness of the games is training the senses
to be more accurate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TRAINING THE EAR</h2>
</div>

<p>This is a very important sense; consider its relation
to memory and how your decisions and judgments
are based upon things you have heard or
thought you heard.</p>

<p>Psychological tests have revealed the fact that the
ear of the average person is mistaken thirty-four
per cent of the time. Think of it&mdash;one-third of
your ear impressions are mistaken. The resulting
memory, judgment and action must suffer. This is
true largely because of lack of a conscious effort to
develop this important sense.</p>


<h3>A Test Exercise</h3>

<p>Have the child stand across the room and listen
for the tick of a watch which you hold in your hand.
If he cannot hear the tick, advance slowly toward
him and keep track of the distance at which the
child first distinguishes the ticking. It will be interesting
to test each ear separately. Any physical
defect in the child's hearing can be found by this
test. Encourage him to make a deliberate effort to
hear the watch. Do not be too hasty in moving
towards him as he will have to concentrate his attention
before the tick can be heard. This exercise is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a good one for the development of attention. Practice
with this yourself. You will find as your attention
wanders that you will lose the consciousness of
the ticking of the watch.</p>


<h3>The Game of Whispering</h3>

<p>Have the child stand across the room or several
feet away. Whisper a word and see if he can repeat
it. Encourage him to try a little more and to be
more quiet; then whisper the same word but no
louder. Work with this exercise, increasing the tone
gradually until the child distinguishes what is said.
Then whisper other words and sentences. This exercise
can be lengthened and is excellent for the development
of attention and memory as well as of
hearing.</p>


<h3>The Game of Tapping</h3>

<p>Sit at a table and with a pencil or your finger tap
upon it a certain number of times, during which
there are irregular intervals, for example&mdash;four
taps&mdash;interval&mdash;two taps&mdash;interval&mdash;five taps&mdash;interval&mdash;one
tap.</p>

<p>Now see if the child can reproduce the correct
number of taps and intervals. This can be varied in
innumerable ways. For older children tap a familiar
tune and see who can recognize it. Let the winner
tap a tune for the others to recognize.</p>


<h3>The Game&mdash;Speak and I'll Name You</h3>

<p>Blindfold one child and have the others sit or
stand around him in a circle. Turn the blindfolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
one around a few times and let him point to anyone,
saying: "Speak and I'll name you." The child
designated, in a natural voice says, "Yes, sir." The
one blindfolded has two chances to guess from the
sound of the voice who the person is. If he guesses
correctly he is released, if not, he must pay a forfeit.
The person pointed out must be blindfolded and take
the next turn. Forfeits may be redeemed in any
manner desired. The game "Ruth and Jacob,"
familiar to everyone, is a good game of sound.</p>


<h3>The Game of Silence</h3>

<p>For developing self-control and relaxation, have
the children practice silence. Have them relax and
show them that the movement of a foot or a hand
makes a slight noise. Have them listen to their
breathing, and then breathe just as quietly as they
can. Drop a pin and have those who heard it put
up their hands. Let them become perfectly quiet
again and drop several pins for them to count. See
who is the most accurate. In all your instructions
to them only whisper. Do not allow them to talk or
whisper at all during this exercise. As you use it
prolong the periods of silence and attention to one
sound or idea. This is a wonderful exercise for the
development of the power of concentration and
should be played often.</p>


<h3>The Game of Drop It</h3>

<p>Have the children sit quietly in a room; have several
different articles in your hands and drop them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
one at a time, on the table. Have the children sitting
with their backs to the table and determine by
the sound what you have dropped. For this exercise
you can use a bunch of keys, coins, pencil, knife,
books, ball&mdash;anything that is available.</p>

<p>After they have become somewhat acquainted
with the articles by sound, drop the different objects
in different places, moving quietly about so that the
children can only determine from the sound what
you have dropped, and where you dropped it. For
example, drop the book on the rug, the keys on the
floor, the pencil on the tiles of the hearth, the coin
on the table, the keys on the mantel. After each
object is dropped, see which child can tell what
was dropped and where. This will teach them to
recognize the object and its location by sound. Do
not overlook the value of competition&mdash;keep a score.</p>


<h3>A Musical Exercise</h3>

<p>The child should be taught to recognize tones, and
the spaces between tones of the scale. Have him
stand with his back to the piano and learn to tell the
difference in the tones that are played. First, use the
octave, then the one-five-eight. Next the one-three-five
eight; then the one-two three, etc. Then introduce
the half-tones. This exercise can be made
more difficult according to age and musical ability.</p>


<h3>The Game of Blind Man's Ears</h3>

<p>Have the child blindfolded and sitting quietly on
the porch and tell all the sounds he hears. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
blindfold will add to the interest and fun, at the same
time insure his dependence upon the sense of hearing.
Let him tell what is approaching; if persons
are walking, how many? If a vehicle is coming,
how many horses, and what kind of a vehicle? Let
him learn to distinguish automobiles by sound, large
cars from small ones, trucks from pleasure cars.</p>

<p>Strive for recognition of the slightest sound, a distant
bird, etc. Try to estimate the distance from
which the sound is coming.</p>

<p>Take the child into the woods, teach him to distinguish
the sounds of the different animals, and if possible
to locate the distance and to estimate the location.
On the ground, in a bush, or up a tree?</p>

<p>Anything which stimulates the child to hear keenly
and accurately is of value. Let the exercise be
adapted to the time and place. When he remarks
"How quiet it is here," it is a good time for him
to realize how many sounds are actually going on
around him.</p>


<h3>The Game of Telephoning</h3>

<p>Give each child a pencil and paper and have them
sit in a row or in different parts of the room equally
distant from the spot selected for the "operator."</p>

<p>Make a list of words; later on short sentences can
be used; have the operator take these and sit about
twelve feet from the children. Let the operator whisper
"Hello," just loud enough for the children to
hear distinctly. The children can raise their hands
when they "get the connection," or hear the "Hello,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
but should not be allowed to speak during the game.</p>

<p>The operator will then whisper the words in the
list slowly, using the same volume of sound as in the
"Hello," giving time between words for each child
to write them. At the conclusion correct the lists,
each child being scored for the number of words
heard correctly. During this game all instructions
should be given in whisper, and perfect quiet maintained
among the children.</p>


<h3>The Bell Game</h3>

<p>Have all the children sit quietly in one room while
some one takes a small bell and goes to some other
room, hall or any other part of the house and rings
the bell softly, just loud enough to be heard in the
room where the children are seated. See which
child can tell most accurately the location where
the bell was rung. Allow the child making the
closest guess to go out and ring the bell.</p>


<h3>The Game of Stop Thief</h3>

<p>Place a table in the center of the room, preferably
one with doors on two sides, or at least more
than one door. On the table place a bell, bunch of
keys or other article difficult to pick up without
making a noise.</p>

<p>Have all but one of the children blindfolded and
seated at the end of the room farthest from the
doors. The child not blindfolded is the Thief and
leaves the room. When everything is perfectly quiet
the Thief tries to enter the room, get the article from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the table and get out without being heard.</p>

<p>If a child hears the Thief, he calls "Stop Thief,"
and if he accurately locates the position of the thief
he takes his place.</p>

<p>This game will teach the children to move quietly
as well as to improve their hearing.</p>


<h3>The Table Game</h3>

<p>After the meal and while enjoying a few minutes
around the table have the children close their eyes
while you take a spoon or fork and tap softly upon
some dish or article on the table. See who can tell
by hearing what the article is and where it is. See
who is most accurate in locating the spot where the
sound is made.</p>

<p>Other interesting games to be played at the table
will be found under the sense of Sight and faculty
of Observation.</p>

<p>Remember it is the effort that counts&mdash;just to
listen will tend to sharpen the sense of hearing.
Well developed senses are the result of repeated
efforts upon the part of their possessor. Try&mdash;keep
on trying.</p>


<h3>Care of the Ears</h3>

<p>Teach the child to respect and value the sense organs
as possessions of great worth and to care for
them properly. Do not allow any kind of abuse, especially
of the ears and eyes. Do not try to wash
too far into the ears, the inner ear is fully protected
by nature and does not need cleansing. Wash as
far as the child's finger will reach and no farther.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TRAINING THE SENSE OF SIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p>This sense has been endowed by nature with special
ability and capacity. The nerves connecting
the eye with the brain are eighteen times larger than
those of any other sense. Their capacity to impress
the brain is therefore many times greater. At the
same time nature has duplicated the sense of sight
and we have the mind's eye, or the faculty of visualization,
by which we can reproduce the visual impression,
or picture, of the thing which we have
seen. This faculty is one of the important foundations
of memory development as you will see in
future chapters.</p>

<p>We are probably more conscious of defects in the
operation of the sense of sight because of the many
opportunities for comparison with others. Children
may differ considerably in their vision but any unusual
condition should prompt a consultation with a
specialist.</p>

<p>Because of the movement possible in this sense
organ and the delicate muscles which control it,
there is the possibility of improvement by muscular
exercise which does not exist in the other senses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The following exercises will strengthen the eye
muscles. They should be practiced by persons of
all ages. It has been found during operations that
some of the eye muscles have been exercised so
little that they have become almost incapable of use.</p>

<p>These exercises are simple, and can be practiced
at odd moments, that would otherwise be wasted.</p>

<p>First&mdash;Move the eye horizontally as far as you
can to the left and then to the right. Continue this
until there is a feeling of fatigue. No physical exercise
should be continued beyond that point.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Move the eyes vertically as far as you
can, up and then down, trying to extend the range
of vision. Continue this alternately until you feel
fatigue.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Roll the eyes from right to left and then
from left to right in as large a circle as possible.</p>

<p>These exercises will keep the eye muscles in a
healthy condition. See to it that the child does not
abuse his eyes; that he does not strain them; always
has plenty of light and that it falls upon the page,
or work, that he is doing. Do not overlook indications
of eye trouble, eye pains, inflamed lids, continued
recurrence of styes, blood-shot eyeballs, or
pain back of the eyes, all should have the attention
of a doctor. "A stitch in time saves nine."</p>


<h3>Strive for More Detail</h3>

<p>There is the greatest difference in the amount of
detail which the eyes of different persons gather
from a glance at an object. Some will only see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tree; others in the same time will see a tree with
spreading branches, small irregularly shaped leaves,
with small black berries and a rough vertically
marked bark. Children should be trained to notice
as much detail as possible. Development along this
line becomes a basis for many other mental operations
which will be discussed later on.</p>


<h3>Exercise for Detail</h3>

<p>Place yourself with the child where you can look
out on the landscape. Pick out some object, tell him
what it is, and have him look until he finds it. Then
let the child pick out some object that he thinks will
be difficult for you to find. It may be a bird, a red
flower, or a hoop. As he develops pick objects
farther away, smaller or partially hidden.</p>


<h3>Another Good Exercise</h3>

<p>Have the child look at a house and give you all
the detail that he can see. Call the child's attention
to the things missed so that he sees the reason for
making an additional effort. The same exercise can
be followed with any object, a tree, an automobile,
or an animal. When in the house use a picture on
the wall, a table, a book case or a coin. You will
find that the longer the child looks at the object the
more detail he will see. The aim is to get him to
notice and mention the details as quickly as possible.
After some practice he will be able to mention them
as rapidly as he can speak. This can be made into
a competitive game when there are several children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Keep score of the number of the details each can
write on a slip of paper in a given length of time.</p>


<h3>Training the Eye to Measure</h3>

<p>The ability to accurately measure with the eye is
a thing that a great many people find very difficult,
if not almost impossible. You are continuously finding
opportunity to use such an ability. A little conscious
effort will work wonders in this regard and
children should not be allowed to grow up without
being trained to intelligently estimate measurements.
In this training begin with larger measurements and
from that work to the finer ones as rapidly as the
child can progress.</p>


<h3>First Exercise</h3>

<p>Have the child determine which of two trees in
the distance is the closest or use any other objects
in the landscape. Walk towards the trees to prove
the matter. Point out things of interest to encourage
the child's observation of nature.</p>


<h3>Second Exercise</h3>

<p>Give the child a foot rule and let him become acquainted
with its length. Then with his fingers on
the table have him indicate the distance which he
believes to equal that of the length of the rule. Lay
it between the child's fingers. Practice until he
knows accurately how long a foot is. At the same
time and for variety he can practice with a half foot
and an inch. Have him compare objects with a foot
rule and determine whether they are longer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
shorter. Then let him measure the objects. Allow
the child to check the measurements himself, this
will increase his definite conception of the length of
a foot.</p>


<h3>The Game of Measuring</h3>

<p>Let the child with his eye, and without a rule,
measure the length of the table, of the book case, the
side of the room, or the height of a door. Have him
do this by eye measurement and not by guess work.
Teach him to start at one end and select a point
which he judges to be one foot from the end and
then to advance the eye to a point one foot from that
and so on, counting as he goes, "one, two, three and
a half"&mdash;whatever he believes is right. Then have
him take the foot rule and check his measurements
accurately.</p>

<p>In the same manner the child should be taught to
know and to be able to measure with the yard stick.
With it, of course, measure larger objects, as the
length of the house, the width of the porch, the distance
from the house to the sidewalk, the width of
the street, the height of the shed, etc. Teach the
child to recognize the distance of a block, a half
mile or a mile, and the size of an acre.</p>

<p>Unless you have had some practice in work of this
kind, you will find yourself busy keeping ahead of
the child. You can get excellent practice and development
which will be of value to you, by entering
into these exercises. Make it a point to become
thoroughly interested in the work yourself, as it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
insure continuation and increased good for the child.
Remember the interest increasing value of competition.</p>

<p>While training the child's eye to measure, excellent
practice will be found in determining comparative
length of lines. The illustrations below will
show some of the ways in which the lines can be
made confusing. The child should be given enough
drill in this exercise so that he learns to judge the
things as they are, and not as they seem.</p>

<p>Have him look at Figure 1 and decide which is the
longer line, a side of the square B or the diameter of
the circle A. Then have him measure carefully.</p>

<p>In like manner compare the height of the two rectangles
in Figure 2. Which line is longest in Figure
3&mdash;AB, CB, or BD? Which vertical lines are tallest
in Figure 4&mdash;those between AB or BC?</p>

<p>In Figure 5 which line is longest, A, B or C?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Good practice can be had in judging the size of
boxes by comparing the length of one box with the
width of another, or any similar measurements. In
each case the measurements should actually be made
so that all error can be corrected.</p>

<p>In the same way practice with size and thickness
of books. Let the child estimate them by inches so
that he learns to determine accurately the difference
in thickness. The carpenter can readily tell the full
inch board from the seven-eights boards by looking
at it or by feeling. His ability to do this is the result
of practice.</p>

<p>The size of type is a good thing to practice with,
as the irregular outlines of the type make it quite
confusing. A sample book of type can be gotten
from any printer. From this the child can also be
taught to become familiar with the common type
faces. This knowledge he can use to good advantage
in later years.</p>

<p>The child should be taught a definite length of step
for the purpose of measurement. In proportion to
his size he can learn to step off two feet or a yard.
He should also know the length in inches of his shoe
for the purpose of checking shorter measurements.</p>

<p>Have the child know his height and estimate the
height of trees, buildings, etc. These estimates can
be checked by computing the proportion of the
length of the shadow thrown by the tree and using
the proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Example</b>&mdash;If the child is five feet tall and his
shadow measures three feet, the shadow is three-fifths
of his height. If the shadow of the tree measures
fifteen feet, the height of the tree is twenty-five
feet.</p>


<h3>Further Development of Sight</h3>

<p>There are two important faculties which are dependent
upon the operation of the eye for usefulness
and accuracy. They are Visualization and Perception.
The games which are given later for the improvement
of these important mental operations will
also develop the sense of sight.</p>

<p>It will be better to use these later exercises where
double results can be accomplished. Give all the
time possible to the games on pages 59 to 69.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE SENSES OF TASTE AND SMELL</h2>
</div>

<p>For most of the mental operations the three senses
already treated are the more important ones. There
are some trades in which the senses of taste and smell
are also important. These can be cultivated readily by
exercises of any nature that stimulate an effort on the
part of the children. Many ideas will suggest themselves
to you from those given for the other senses.</p>

<p>It is advisable to do a good deal of the practice blindfolded
so as to separate entirely the sense of sight, and
force dependence upon the senses of taste and smell.</p>

<p>These two senses are very closely allied. Try the experiment
of determining the difference in tea, coffee,
milk and water while the eyes are covered and the nose
held tightly closed.</p>

<p>The degree to which these two senses can be developed
is illustrated by the proficiency which is shown by
experts and testers who grade tea, coffee and tobacco.</p>

<p>The usefulness of their development is to a large degree
only of value to those engaged in these lines of
trade. The opportunity for their development comes
rarely except in connection with work in the trades, and
for that reason will not be dealt with at any length here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>


<h3>Using Two of the Senses</h3>

<p>There are times when the ability to use two of the
senses with reasonable accuracy at the same time will
be of value. It is not possible for either of the senses to
produce perfect attention while working in conjunction
with one another. We can attend to only one thing at a
time and do it well, but "Divided Attention" is possible.
Under the chapter on Attention and Concentration, on
page 75, you will find an explanation of "Divided Attention,"
which should be read before going farther with
these exercises.</p>


<h3>Exercises for Two Senses</h3>

<p>Combine any of the previous exercises for Eye and
Ear, Ear and Feeling, Eye and Feeling, etc., but do not
attempt two exercises of the same sense or use two of
the same order.</p>

<p>At first the attention will alternate between the two
exercises, but by persistence the child can learn to
carry on two exercises at the same time.</p>

<p>Watch an operator in the central phone stations, she
listens to the party calling, watches the board over
which other conversations are passing, and pulls and
shifts the plugs, all at the same time. Operators of
many machines in factories learn to carry on two and
more separate operations at one time.</p>

<p>Combine the Insets for the sense of feeling on page
18 with the Number Game or the Letter Game on page
45, or with the exercises for visual counting on page
59. Let the Insets be held close to the body so as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to be easily seen, or have them worked under the table,
or covered by a cloth.</p>

<p>Use a similar combination of any of the sense exercises
or games. Try many variations of the idea given
on page 75 under Divided Attention, using different
verses and problems to suit the age of the child.</p>

<p>Have the child write a familiar verse while listening
to the reading of a story and see how much he can
tell after the verse is finished. See that the writing
continues during the reading, that is, that he does not
stop writing to listen, then write again.</p>

<p>Take the letter cards of the Letter Game, page 45,
and arrange a series of six, having these covered. Give
the child a paper and pencil, uncover the series of letters
and simultaneously read an equal series of digits.
After the reading cover the letters and have him write
as many as possible, first the letters and immediately
following the digits. Next time write the digits first
and the letters second. The result of this test will reveal
the comparative quality of the child's eye and ear
memory, as memory must of course enter into this exercise.
If the sounds of the digits are lost before the
pictures of the letters, the eye memory is strongest.
This is usually the case, but some children will retain
the sounds easily and lose the picture of the letters.</p>

<p>The sense which proves most useful should be depended
upon for accuracy, but there should be a continuous
effort to develop and strengthen the weaker one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>


<h3>Improvement From Conscious Effort</h3>

<p>The child may be normal in all his senses and able
to gain an average success in life without much conscious
effort given to improving them. It will require
very little effort, however, to greatly develop the capacity
of the different senses and thus increase the
success which he will gain, and greatly reduce the
effort necessary to attain it. While effort and use
develop, neglect causes disintegration.</p>

<p>The fact that the eye, for example, needs development
is illustrated by the limited usefulness of this
organ in infants. Professor Compayre tells us that
babies see only objects in front of them, not to the right
or to the left, and only objects that are at short range.</p>

<p>Your present capacity in the use of this sense organ,
and the accuracy with which you use it, is the result
of the development of past years. Conscious effort upon
the part of your children will lead them to more rapid
development, and to the possibility of far greater power
and usefulness.</p>

<p>The value of this improvement is apparent to you,
but not to the child. The benefits to be derived will be
largely dependent upon your leadership and encouragement
in making the effort. While the children are seeking
amusement, see that they combine it with these
games and exercises which will accomplish some improvement
that will be permanent and valuable to them
later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Faculty of Visualization</h3>

<p>The sense of sight has been wonderfully endowed
with a duplicate power which we have come to call the
mind's eye. With this visual faculty we produce some
very important mental operations. We must first become
conscious of this faculty and learn to use it intelligently
and then to broaden its scope and increase its
power to deal with details.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Visualization is the mind's eye reproduction of
an impression made by the sense of sight.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>When the name of Abraham Lincoln is mentioned
you can see his face in your mind's eye. Hesitate a moment
and become really conscious of this reproduction
of Lincoln's face in your mind. See the details of the
picture, the deep set eyes, the furrowed skin, the sad
expression, etc.</p>


<h3>Another Visual Test</h3>

<p>In the same manner your mind can reproduce an unlimited
number of pictures. Anything which you have
once seen with the physical eye can be reproduced again
in the mind's eye.</p>

<p>Make a few tests of this fact, if it is not well known
to you. For example,&mdash;</p>

<p>See a pasture with a creek flowing through, willows
hanging over the water, the green grass on the banks,
and the stock grazing there. See several different
kinds and sizes of animals, note their color, what they
are doing. Add to the detail of the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>To close the eyes and thus to eliminate the more distinct
impressions of the physical eye, will assist you in
visualizing any picture.</p>


<h3>Visual Process Natural</h3>

<p>We are all born with this ability to visualize or see
imaginary mental reproductions of things which we
have seen before. By the use of the imagination we
combine parts of these pictures into new ones and thus
are able to construct a mind's eye picture which may
never have existed in fact.</p>

<p>Children possess this faculty in a marked degree;
they use it continuously and unconsciously. They can
also see their visual picture much more clearly than
their parents can, unless they have continued to use the
faculty consciously. Many children amuse themselves
by the hour in playing with imaginary playmates, and
will talk to them as interestedly as if they were really
present. To the child they are present, he actually
sees them and also visualizes the conditions under which
he is playing.</p>

<p>The child should be given a conscious understanding
of the mind's eye picture and what is meant by visualization.
Teach him that when you ask him to visualize,
you mean for him to see clearly the mind's eye picture
of the thing referred to. The first exercises in visualization
are for the purpose of developing a clear visual
picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<h3>Training the Mind's Eye</h3>

<p>The following tests and games will reveal the lack
of speed and accuracy in the operation of the visual faculty.
The repetition of the tests will result in an improved
ability; vary and continue them and you can
quickly experience improvement in the availability of
the faculty.</p>

<p>Exercises which tend to quicken the action, broaden
the range of vision, and increase the amount of detail
retained, are most valuable.</p>


<h3>The Picture Test</h3>

<p>Select a good sized picture which is strange to the
child, in which there are several persons surrounded by
the furniture of a room, or any similar setting where
there are a number of objects. Allow him to give one
quick glance at the picture and then see whether he
can recall definitely just how many persons were in the
picture? Whether they were men, women or children;
and locate definitely the position of each person. The
first glance should not exceed one second. Now let him
look at the picture again for not more than five seconds.
See how many objects he can name, check them
up to see that he is accurate. Also notice how many
objects are mentioned which are not in the picture.</p>


<h3>Test for Quick Reaction</h3>

<p>Prepare a strip of cardboard about three inches wide
and fourteen inches long. Get as many colors of paper
as possible, cut them into strips of unequal width and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
paste them on the cardboard so that each color will be
from one to three inches wide, according to the number
secured.</p>

<p>Stand across the room holding the back of the strip
towards the children, then turn it over so that they get
one clear glance. This glance should not exceed the
length of time it takes you to count rapidly one-half the
number of colors. There should not be less than six colors
on the slip, in which case you count from one to
three. After this first quick glance see who can tell
accurately HOW MANY colors there are on the slip.
Let each write down the number his mind registered
without checking up to see if he is correct.</p>


<h3>A Test for Color Reaction</h3>

<p>Now turn the paper over again so that they see the
colors about twice as long as the first test. Then have
them write a list of the colors that are on the paper.
After they have written all the colors that they saw,
have them take the following tests, before checking up
the lists.</p>


<h3>A Test for Order</h3>

<p>Allow a third glance at the color strip while you
count ten, and have each begin at the left hand end of
the strip, noting the arrangement of the colors, and see
if they can write accurately the order in which the
colors appear on the card.</p>

<p>The first test is for quick reaction of the mind. The
amount that they are able to observe in a given length
of time will depend upon the rapidity with which their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
minds react. This test is designed to determine the
rapidity of the mental reaction. About thirty-five per
cent of those who take it are able to get the correct
number, where the number of colors is not more than
seven.</p>

<p>The second test is designed to determine the ability
of the mind to hold the color impressions. About
twenty-five per cent are able to retain the impression
of the seven colors.</p>

<p>The third test combines the power to retain the color
impression with the ability to retain the correct order.
Experience shows that not over ten per cent are able
to give the order accurately.</p>

<p>Similar tests repeated will give a great amount of
exercise and soon result in a perceptible increase in
the power to accomplish the desired results.</p>


<h3>The Letter Game</h3>

<p>Prepare a series of white cards about 2 X 3 inches,
larger for larger groups, on which are painted the letters
of the alphabet in large black type.</p>

<p>For this test select a convenient spot, such as the
mantel, window sill, or table edge, and place six letters
upright and side by side, but do not have the letters
spell a word.</p>

<p>Each child should be supplied with paper and pencil.
All should hold the pencil above their heads. Upon a
signal allow the children a five-second glance at the
letters. When the five seconds have elapsed give the
command "Write," at which each child will write the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
letters in proper sequence. When they have had ten
seconds in which to write, give the command "stop."
During the time for writing the letters the cards should
be covered. Now the cover can be removed and each
allowed to check the result.</p>

<p>Begin with the arrangement of about six letters and
gradually increase the number and complexity of arrangement
so as always to give the child something to
strive for.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Only that which requires effort results in
growth. Those things for which we strive are
of most value to us.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>A few examples for the letter game&mdash;</p>

<div class="block-center">
<div class="aligned-text">M D L T R X</div>
<div class="aligned-text">X O M E R S</div>
<div class="aligned-text">E A M N R T V</div>
<div class="aligned-text">T E X R L O S</div>
<div class="aligned-text">A X M E V A L R</div>
<div class="aligned-text">Y A C O P T E L</div>
</div>

<p>Later arrange some double line combinations, and
increase the complexity as the ability develops.</p>


<div class="block-center">
<div class="aligned-text">Y&mdash;E&mdash;O&mdash;P &nbsp; &nbsp; X&mdash;O&mdash;J&mdash;R &nbsp; &nbsp; M&mdash;P&mdash;S&mdash;Q</div>

<div class="aligned-text">E&mdash;M&mdash;T&mdash;A &nbsp; &nbsp; B&mdash;Z&mdash;Y&mdash;E &nbsp; &nbsp; R&mdash;E&mdash;T&mdash;W</div>

<div class="aligned-text"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; L&mdash;V&mdash;D&mdash;H</div>
</div>

<p>In some combinations use letters which make the
semblance of a word and later some which spell a word.
Notice how quickly and easily the combination is re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>membered
when it conveys sense or something definite
which the mind can grasp. For example&mdash;</p>

<div class="block-center">
<div class="aligned-text">T&mdash;E&mdash;X&mdash;O &nbsp; &nbsp; A&mdash;M&mdash;I&mdash;T &nbsp; &nbsp; C&mdash;O&mdash;C&mdash;O</div>

<div class="aligned-text">B&mdash;R&mdash;A&mdash;S &nbsp; &nbsp; C&mdash;R&mdash;E&mdash;P &nbsp; &nbsp; J&mdash;U&mdash;B&mdash;S</div>

<div class="aligned-text"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F&mdash;I&mdash;N&mdash;O</div>
</div>

<h3>The Number Game</h3>

<p>In the same manner in which you made the cards for
the Letter Game prepare a set on which are numbers
instead of letters. Follow the same rules for the
Number Game, using rows of numbers instead of
letters.</p>

<p>First use a row of single digits, increasing it until
you have used nine or ten. Then change and arrange a
column of two digits, as illustrated below.</p>

<p>Later for variety you can combine letters and numbers.
In some arrangements leave blank spaces requiring
the child to leave the blank in its proper location
when reproducing his mental picture.</p>

<h3>A Few Examples for Guidance</h3>


<div class="block-center">
<div class="aligned-text">23 &nbsp; &nbsp; 50 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 5 1 7 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 906 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4</div>
<div class="aligned-text">46 &nbsp; &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; &nbsp; 9 6 8 1 4 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; &nbsp; 16</div>
<div class="aligned-text">19 &nbsp; &nbsp; 48 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 7 4 6 1 2 0&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;010 &nbsp; &nbsp; 372</div>
<div class="aligned-text">43 &nbsp; &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 5 1 9 3 5 4 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; 9 &nbsp; &nbsp;5680</div>
<div class="gap-20"></div>
<div class="aligned-text">X &nbsp;&nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 7 6 A 9 E X 5 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; T4 &nbsp;&nbsp;  AX</div>
<div class="aligned-text">9 &nbsp; E&nbsp; 4&nbsp; B &nbsp;&nbsp;A 7 X 6 4 B C 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;6E &nbsp;&nbsp;  96</div>
<div class="aligned-text">1 &nbsp; &nbsp;O &nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp; X T O M 1 4 9 &nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp; 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;  D7</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>


<p>A series of squares, circles, triangles, etc., can be
used. These exercises can be varied in any manner
and made as long and as complicated as is necessary
to keep the child striving to make an effort to accomplish
more. Keep a time limit, remember the value
of competition, championship scores, etc.</p>


<h3>The Colors of a Room</h3>

<p>Have the child look at one side of the room, then
look away and tell all the colors he saw there in pictures,
draperies, etc. Have him look at a certain picture
for about five seconds and turn away and see how
many of the colors in it he can recall.</p>

<p>Use a row of books on the shelf for another test.
Have the child tell how many colors he saw in the row,
and, if possible, how many books.</p>


<h3>Practice With Geometrical Figures</h3>

<p>First secure some geometrical figures. Take for example
a five-pointed star, have the child look at it carefully,
then close his eyes and reproduce its form and
size in a clear, visual picture. Let him look at the drawing
and see if he can improve the clearness and definite
proportion of his mind's eye picture. Now have him
take a sheet of paper and draw this picture as he sees
it in his mind, and when complete compare it with the
original for accuracy in size and proportion. Let him
close his eyes several times and get just as definite a
mind's eye picture as possible before he attempts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
drawing of the figure. Practice with figures of this
kind, gradually increasing their complexity.</p>


<h3>Use Other Simple Objects</h3>

<p>Instead of the geometrical figures of the previous exercise,
take some simple object, such as a coin, a key, a
watch charm, or a book. Follow the same plan as above.
Have the child make a complete mind's eye picture,
then try to draw it.</p>


<h3>Color Practice Valuable</h3>

<p>Secure a number of colored objects, such as sheets
of paper, or book covers, or candy boxes, anything which
is colored. Let the child study the color carefully, then
reproduce it in his mind's eye. First he must work with
single colors, then combine two or three in a group, and
reproduce them in his mind's eye. In following this
exercise he will develop an accurate color memory.</p>


<h3>Out-of-Door Games</h3>

<p>Select a certain tree and let the child look at it intently
for a few seconds, then ask him to close his eyes,
or look away, and describe the tree to you. Try to get
him to see clearly all the detail in his mind's eye picture,
as you did in the former exercises for the physical eye.</p>


<h3>Use Entire Landscape</h3>

<p>In the same way have the child visualize the landscape.
Let him look at it intently for a few moments,
and then, with his eyes closed, describe it. The descrip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>tion
which the child gives will reveal the amount of detail
in his mind's eye picture. Try again, and see how
much he can add at the second trial.</p>


<h3>Immediate Visualization</h3>

<p>The rapidity of visualization can be greatly increased
by effort and training. There is great value in this ability,
and it can be attained by shortening the interval
during which the object or exercise is visible to the eye.</p>

<p>After the children have learned to form a definite,
accurate picture, try to shorten the time in which they
see the objects. Strive until they can take in the whole
at a glance. The detail will continue to develop after
the eyes are closed. In the Letter and Number Games
gradually shorten the time given until they can reproduce
the entire row at a glance. Such effort will
quicken the action of the brain area of sight.</p>

<p>The story is told of a woman who so developed this
ability that she could secure a picture of the page of a
letter in one glance and read it from the visual image.
She became a well-known government agent in a foreign
country, an internationally known spy.</p>

<p>All of the exercise given for the development of the
sense of sight can be used for visualization and later
for observation. These two important faculties are
closely related to each other and both dependent upon
the eye. Later on you will see that the most used of all
the faculties&mdash;Memory&mdash;is in turn largely dependent
upon all three.</p>

<h3>Training of Younger Children</h3>

<p>Up to eight years of age the child should be trained
principally in the use of his senses and in making clear
mind's eye pictures. The parent should have the definite
aim in mind of increasing the child's stock of
knowledge, and of the later value of these efforts.
Show him everything you can, and take time to explain.
Things are new to the child, even though they are very
common to you. This is the age when he acquires his
knowledge of things without being so much interested
in their relationship to each other.</p>

<p>A great deal which is explained to children is forgotten,
because they did not sense it&mdash;that is, they do
not impress it upon the mind by many and varied sense
impressions. Simply to hear the answer to the question
is not sufficient. You can tell a child what a rectangle
is, but he is very apt to forget. If, after you have explained
a rectangle to the child, you have him go around
the room and find all the rectangles that he can&mdash;such
as windows, doors, books, etc., and then draw different
sizes of them, he will never forget.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DEVELOPING THE OBSERVATION</h2>
</div>

<p>The next step of development, after forming clear
visual impressions, and closely allied to it, is the development
of the faculty of observation. The eyes see,
but the brain perceives. The sense organs bring a
sensation to the brain where, by the act of perception,
it is classified or identified as being like certain other
objects and filed away in its proper place.</p>

<p>Recognition goes a step farther and places this object
alongside of one particular mental image, which it
resembles.</p>

<p>Standing by the gate in the twilight you see an object
coming down the road. As it approaches you Perceive
that it is a cow. As it comes closer you Recognize it as
Neighbor Jones' cow. You Perceive that it is a cow,
but you Recognize her as a certain cow, different from
all others.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the eye may be perfect, and the nerve
connecting it with the brain may be in good working
order, and yet no impression may be received by the
brain. Injury to that area of the brain which receives
the impression from the eye may cause total blindness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at the same time the eye and nerves connecting it with
the brain may be physically perfect.</p>

<p>When the brain is not injured, the same result is
brought about by lack of Attention. The eye can look
straight at an object and you do not perceive it. The
brain does not accept any impression of it.</p>

<p>Attention is necessary that the sense impressions
may be properly perceived and recognized; and this
completed mental operation is commonly called Observation.
Trained senses that react quickly make possible
quick perception and recognition. The result is
quick, accurate, and complete observation. Observation
requires knowledge and it develops definite knowledge,
but most people are poor observers. Help your children
to be definite in their knowledge and to know what
they know. How many can tell the different trees by
name? How many legs has a spider, a fly, a bee, a
butterfly?</p>

<p>It is a strange fact that the poorly educated are the
best observers. Do not lose sight of the necessity of
helping the child to form the habit of observation. It
is the basis of common sense. Do not let him grow up
ignorant of the common knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>The faculty of observation is also the basis of science
and of the success of specialists in every line. The story
is told of a young man, who, having made up his mind
to become a naturalist, went to a celebrated teacher in
that line of study. The professor set the young man at
work drawing a picture of a fish. The picture was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
finished and carried to the teacher for inspection, who,
without looking up, said: "Draw it again." This seemed
foolish to the young man, but he sat down and drew a
new and better picture, which he again carried to the
teacher for approval. This time the professor told him
to go back and improve it and to wait until he should
come to inspect it. The young scholar returned, did
some more work on the picture and then pushed it
back and waited. The professor did not come and
so he started wandering restlessly around the room,
thinking he had been forgotten.</p>

<p>Soon he became interested in studying the fish he
had been drawing; he noticed several peculiarities of
the eye which he added to his picture. This led him to a
more careful study, and other details were noted and
added. He then decided he could draw a better picture,
so started all over again. After days had passed, the
professor came in and glanced at the picture which the
young man then realized was still only partially complete.
For one year this young scholar was kept busy
studying and drawing the fish, then the old professor
told him: "You have learned the greatest lesson of the
scientist, observation." This young man was Agassiz,
who became America's foremost naturalist.</p>

<p>Observation usually occurs where there is a motive.
Do not ask the child to develop it, but induce him to
play games and to strive to excel in contests which
require observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>


<h3>Value of Observation</h3>

<p>This is one of the faculties which we use continuously,
but have given very little thought to its conscious
improvement. Every judgment rendered in business
life is largely dependent for accuracy upon this
faculty.</p>

<p>You may intend investing money in a piece of real
estate. You go out to look at it. What you see on this
trip of inspection is a large factor in your decision.
Your ability to observe all existing conditions will go
a long way towards determining whether or not your
judgment in buying this property is correct. If the
surrounding land is higher, and you do not observe this
fact, you will probably discover, when winter comes,
that you have purchased a mud hole.</p>

<p>Two men go to inspect a piece of mining property.
Mr. A decides to invest, while Mr. B decides not to. In
talking over the situation later on A inquires of B why
he did not invest, and finds that B saw many things
about the location of the property which he did not
see at all.</p>

<p>In every decision of life we depend largely upon our
observation; upon the things we see. A keen observation
is of great help to the salesman in finding a point
of contact with the prospective buyer. When he enters
the man's office his eyes are keen and alert. He sees
the golf bag or tennis racquet in the corner, or a book
on the man's desk, the title of which he can read at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
glance. These things reveal to him the things in which
this man is interested.</p>

<p>If all faces look alike to you you will of course call
them all by the same name. Your friends are all different
in their appearance. It is your observation
which detects this difference. You may have thought
that Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith look very much alike, but
when you see the two side by side you are surprised
that you ever thought they resembled each other. Such
cases are not at all rare, and show that the observation
has not been as keen and accurate as it should have
been.</p>


<h3>The Neglected Faculty</h3>

<p>Observation can be improved easily and quickly. This
is one of the faculties which is used so habitually that
we have overlooked its importance and almost entirely
neglected its improvement. The following pages will
give some tests by which you can determine the child's
power of observation and which will convince you of
the need of its development, and also suggest some
simple games by means of which you and your children
can improve this important mental faculty.</p>

<p>It is a great aid to observation to have the ability
to place upon the brain a physical eye picture which is
so clear and distinct that later, when you reproduce the
picture in the mind's eye, you still see the details accurately.
To develop this power of visualization will help
to develop the ability to observe. The exercises in the
development of observation which follow will also improve
the visual power of the mind's eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<h3>Method of Developing Observation</h3>

<p>The story is told how the French magician Houdin
trained the observation of his son. They would go
down the street together and stop in front of a shop
window. The father and son would both take a good
look at the contents of the window, and then walk on a
little farther and stop and write on a pad all the objects
they could recall. Then they would go back to the window
and compare the lists, and go on to a second window
and do the same thing. This exercise was followed
until the boy had developed an unusual ability to remember
what he saw.</p>

<p>When the father was performing his magical feats
on the stage of Paris he would ask people from the
audience to come up onto the stage and deposit any
articles which they chose upon the table until there
were forty in all. The boy, blindfolded, was then
brought onto the stage, led up to the table, and, after
the blindfold was removed, allowed one glance. He was
then blindfolded again and led to the front of the stage
with his back to the table. He would without hesitation
name each of the forty objects. This was considered
magic, mental telepathy, etc. It <i>was</i> magic&mdash;the
magic of practice.</p>

<p>Practice will work wonders for you and your children.
The method followed by this magician is one of
the best exercises for developing this faculty. The time
you put in walking the streets is mostly wasted as far
as mental development is concerned. As you and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
children pass a store window look closely at the articles
in it and as you walk along see how many each of you
can recall definitely. At first you will not be able to
name very many. Practice in this way several times a
day will soon enable you to recall the majority of things
that you see. Continual practice will result in your becoming
an adept.</p>

<p>The same kind of practice can be indulged in on
streets where there are no store windows. Look at
the front of a house and see how definitely you can describe
it after you are by. How many windows has it?
Can you see the color, trimmings, the style of windows,
doors, porches, and all the details clearly? Practice until
all can do this. Then observe the yard until you can
describe the approximate size, the arrangement of the
shrubbery, walks, flower beds and trees. While walking
with the children continuously use these ideas. Call
their attention to a certain house and when you have
passed ask questions regarding what they have observed.</p>

<p>An excellent method of developing observation is to
recall the definite location of the furniture in the different
rooms of the home, the articles that are on the
top of the dresser or library table.</p>

<p>In going to the home or office of a friend look around
the room once carefully, then look out of the window
or at the floor, and recall the furniture and other details
of the furnishings. How many pictures are on
the walls, where are they and what are they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<h3>Picture Cards for Observation</h3>

<p>Secure a group of pictures which have considerable
detail and a variety of objects such as often
appear on calendars, large magazine pictures, and
advertisements, etc.</p>

<p>Put a single picture upon the wall for observation
for a period of a few seconds. Let each child write the
answers to a series of questions, each being numbered.
They can be answered verbally if the group is small.</p>

<p>Have the list of questions prepared and numbered. If
the picture is of a house and yard have questions like
the following: How many chimneys? How many
windows upstairs, downstairs? How many porches?
What color is the house? the trimmings? How
many trees, bushes, flower beds? Is there a fence?
Is the door open or closed? Is there any person in
the picture? Any animal?</p>


<h3>Counting From Mind's Eye Pictures</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="GROUP 1." /></div>

<p class="caption">GROUP 1.</p>

<p>Take a piece of paper, or a child's slate, place a simple
group of small circles, as illustrated in
Group One. Let the child look at this
group for five seconds. Turn the slate
over and have him count from his mind's
eye picture and tell how many circles
are in the group. Then have the child
draw on the other side of the slate or on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
another piece of paper the circles as
nearly in the same position as possible.</p>

<p>See that he gets the advantage of two
tests from this exercise, one the counting
from his mind's eye picture and the
other to be able to reproduce the group
in the same positions as shown on the
other side of the slate.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060a.jpg" alt="GROUP 2." /></div>
<p class="caption">GROUP 2.</p>

<p>Make another group of mixed crosses
and circles as shown in Group Two.
After looking at it for five seconds, have
the child tell you how many circles and
how many crosses there are. Have him
draw a picture of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060b.jpg" alt="GROUP 3." /></div>
<p class="caption">GROUP 3.</p>

<p>Use a group of combined circles and
squares as illustrated in Groups Three
and Four. As the child becomes able
to count and reproduce accurately, increase
the difficulty and complexity of
the exercises. For variety use triangles,
rectangles, octagons, stars, etc.,
as in Group Four.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060c.jpg" alt="GROUP 4." /></div>
<p class="caption">GROUP 4.</p>


<h3>For Visual Reproduction</h3>

<p>Divide a slate or a sheet of paper into four, six, nine
or twelve sections. Beginning with four and increasing
the number as the child progresses. Draw in each
section some picture, number, letter or object, as illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>trated.
Let the child look at
those which you have arranged
and then close his eyes and look
away and tell what is in each of
the squares. If he is old enough,
let him take a piece of paper and
reproduce the squares and their
contents. For variety the
squares can contain all letters,
all numbers, or all objects.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<h3>The Game of Quick Counting</h3>

<p>Have a handful of small sticks or matches and lay
a number in a row on the table. Let the children stand
with their backs to the table and a few feet away from
it. After you have arranged the sticks go several feet
away from the table and say, "Ready!" The children
then go to the table, count the sticks, run to you and
whisper their answer. The object in your being away
from the table is to keep the others from repeating the
answer of the first child when they have not finished
the count for themselves. From a simple beginning of
a straight row of a few sticks, the game can be developed
to any degree of complexity, so that it will tax
the powers of the most alert and developed mind.
The children will soon be able to glance at the group
of sticks and count them from their mind's eye picture
while they are coming to you and not have to
stand at the table while counting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay the sticks in groups, make them into figures,
into small piles, double lines of different length, etc. A
few different groups are illustrated below&mdash;use
matches, tooth picks, or any small articles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<h3>The Game of Visual Counting</h3>

<p>Take the same game described above for Quick
Counting and have the children see the figure or pile of
sticks for just a moment, then cover them and let them
count from their visual picture and tell the number,
rather than by the actual count as before. They can
also have a handful of sticks in their hands and each
try to arrange a group of sticks which is the duplicate
of the one they have been observing.</p>

<p>The game of dominoes is good for small children in
helping them to count quickly and accurately. Use a
row of dominoes instead of sticks and have the children
count the number of spots from their mind's eye picture.</p>

<p>For variety use any objects, let the child look at a
flag and count the stars. Have him count the number
of squares in a colonial window; the number of books
on a shelf; the number of sections in the radiator. Anything
of this kind can be easily used. Give him only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
glance, do not allow time enough for an actual count.
In each case let the time allowed for each exercise be
less than required to count the objects.</p>


<h3>Reproducing the Visual Picture</h3>

<p>Show the child a vase, or the picture of one that is
odd in shape, a water pitcher, or an Egyptian water
bottle. Let him have a good look at the object, then
take it away and let him describe it in detail, or, better
still, have him draw it. Drawing is an excellent
exercise for the development of muscular control
and will-power.</p>

<p>In the same way let children observe the decorations
of a building, the design of the windows, the design
and style of the caps and bases of the pillars, and then
draw them.</p>

<p>Older girls should be taught to observe so as to be
able to describe accurately, and to draw in detail, suits
and dresses; draperies and furnishings. This is also an
excellent opportunity for color study. Boys can observe,
describe and draw the outlines of boats, automobiles,
and furniture, and anything that interests
them. An excellent book to help the child in learning to
draw is one entitled, "When Mother Lets Us Draw,"
by E. R. Lee Thayer.</p>


<h3>The Game of Color Cards</h3>

<p>To develop Observation and Memory of location, and
relation of objects, get eight cards of any size, from one
to three inches square, each of a different color. Colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of decided contrast are best. Number the cards on the
back from one to eight. While the child is not looking
arrange the cards in a double row, writing the number
of each card on a slip of paper. The numbers should be
in two rows and in the exact order in which the color
cards are to be arranged. Call the child and let him
look twenty seconds at these cards. The time can be
shortened as the ability develops. Now mix the cards
and let him try to arrange them as they were.</p>

<p>The one taking the test should do this by making a
picture of the colors as they appear, holding them in
mind as he arranges the cards. This is excellent practice
for persons of all ages. Some can do it accurately
at the first trial, others will have a poor record at the
beginning, but as usual <i>persistence</i> will win and the
ability will grow rapidly.</p>

<p>The Score.&mdash;The numbers, as you have previously
written them on the slip, will give the original order.
After they have been arranged by the one taking the
test, turn the cards and check by the numbers. Each
card in its correct place entitles him to one point. Any
number can be decided upon as a game. The first one
reaching that number of points by correct arrangement
wins.</p>

<p>If colored cardboard is not handy the cards can
easily be made by painting one side with a child's
water color paints or by using crayolas.</p>


<h3>The Game of Picture Cards</h3>

<p>This game will develop observation and location.
Make a series of eight, ten, or twelve cards about 2x3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
inches in size, on one side number them as in the color
game, and on the other side draw the outlines of simple
objects, as a hat, tea kettle, shears, box, fan, book, owl,
hen, dog, etc. These pictures can be cut from a paper
and pasted on the cards; small picture cards, or picture
postals may be used.</p>

<p>Arrange the cards in two rows. You can begin with
four or six cards and later, after these have been used
with comparative accuracy, add more. Keep a record
of the arrangement by the numbers on the back of the
cards as in the Color Game. Allow about twenty seconds
for the observation of the cards and their positions,
then shuffle them and arrange them in the original
position if possible. Score the same as in the
Color Game.</p>


<h3>The Seeing Game</h3>

<p>Take the child into some room with which he is
not familiar, and let him walk through the room slowly,
then go out and make a list of everything he can remember.
Now let him look through again and see
what he can add to the list.</p>

<p>Walk a block down the street and have him make
a list or tell you of as many of the things which he saw
as possible. Whenever possible return for a second
look so that the child may see and realize the many
things that he has omitted.</p>

<p>The story of the experience of the magician Houdin
and the method which he used for developing the observation
of his son can easily suggest a number of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>teresting,
and as you have learned, very profitable
games.</p>


<h3>The Game of Detective</h3>

<p>Place a dozen objects on a table and let the child
look at the table from twenty to thirty seconds and
then leave the room. While gone change the position
of two objects. Have him return and tell what changes
were made. Where there are two or more children let
the one who first observes the change remain and make
the change for the others. The number of objects
changed can be varied. But those out of the room
should know how many changes are being made. At
first the objects changed should be returned to their
original positions, before the second change, so that the
mental picture is the same each time. Later they can
remain in the position to which they were changed so
that there is a new relationship to be retained in mind
each time.</p>


<h3>A Game at the Dining Table</h3>

<p>After a meal, while sitting at the table, let the children
take a careful look at what is upon it and then
close their eyes. Ask the location of different things
and see how many they can remember accurately.
While their eyes are closed take something off the table
and hide it. See which one can first tell what is removed.
Return it and next remove some other article.
Let the child first telling what was removed be the one
to remove the next article, and so on, or take turns
around the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Change About Game</h3>

<p>Let all the persons playing the game look over the
furnishings of the room and then all, but one, go out.
The person remaining can change the location of one
article but nothing must be removed. When the alteration
is made the others may return. The first one to detect
the change must remain and make the change for
the others. At first the changes should be made of
larger articles as the chairs, pictures, pillows, etc.
Later smaller ones can be used as vases, doilies, books,
bric-a-brac.</p>

<p>A time limit can be placed upon the observation
of the room and also upon the time allowed for detecting
the change made. A score can be kept among
smaller children rather than to allow them to make the
changes.</p>


<h3>The Game of Observation</h3>

<p>Gather a group of small articles and place them on
a table. Begin with not less than twenty articles and
increase the number as those making the test become
accurate. Have the children gather around the table
and look intently at the objects upon it, striving to make
a picture of the group in their minds. After they have
looked at the table for thirty seconds cover it and have
them write a list of all the articles they can recall from
their mental impression. The one writing the longest
list is the winner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to allow them a second observation of
twenty seconds after they have written the first list
and see how many more they can add to it. After the
child has written all that he thinks he can, have him
close his eyes and see the mind's eye picture of the top
of the table and in this way concentrate on the picture.
You will find that in most cases this will recall to mind
other objects, they will gradually become definite in the
picture and can be added to the list. Few people are
able to write more than twenty objects from a one minute
observation of a table containing thirty, but there
are some who can do much better at the first trial.
These are usually persons who have been engaged in
some line of effort which causes the development of the
faculty.</p>

<p>This is an excellent mental exercise and should be
repeated as often as you can induce the children to play
it, adding to the articles and changing some for variety.
Play this at the children's parties. Older persons
enjoy it as well as the younger ones, especially after
they see how difficult it is.</p>


<h3>Training the Sense of Location</h3>

<p>One valuable application of the habit of attention and
observation is that it develops the memory for places.
The keen, observing woodsman is not easily lost. Some
people can be lost a few blocks from home simply because
they do not observe where they go, the objects
which they pass, or the relation of one building or
corner to another. Impress the importance of this ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>plication
of observation upon the child. Teach him to
pick landmarks. Show him how the Indian or woodsman
blazes a trail as he goes through an unknown
country. Teach the child to notice the roads, fences,
trees, houses and buildings as he walks. Teach him the
directions and how to find them.</p>


<h3>The Game of Guide</h3>

<p>Take the child for a walk. Tell him that the next
day you are going to see if he can take you for the
same walk. Have him observe the different places
you go. After you have been home for an hour or
so let the child go over the walk in his mind and review
it visually so that he will be able to take you
the next day. Review is necessary for a permanent
memory, and this act will help the child to realize
the importance of forming the review habit.</p>


<h3>The Game of Guiding Home</h3>

<p>Take the child for a walk and double back over your
track and see if he will recognize the fact that he has
been there before. Take him to the same place by different
roads and let him guide you back home. When
you are ready to go home after a walk let the child play
the game of taking you home. He will enjoy this and it
will develop independence and the ability to get home
alone if such a necessity should arise. Occasionally ask
him what direction you are traveling and in which direction
his home is located. When the corner is turned
have him tell the new direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<h3>Make Play Profitable</h3>

<p>In your play with the child make it a point to choose
some game which will develop his senses and faculties.
You can amuse him as easily and at the same time be
accomplishing a great good. Do not put this matter off
"until you have more time." Use a little time each day,
if only five minutes. You are bound to experience to
some extent the same result as a friend who said: "I
started in with this thing for the good of the kids, but
I find the kid who gets the most out of it is dad."</p>

<p>Rudyard Kipling, in his book "Kim," gives an instance
of the Observation Game played by Kim and a
trained native youth. Lurgan Sahib exposes to the
sight of the two boys a tray filled with jewels and
gems, allowing them to gaze upon it a few moments
before it is withdrawn from sight. Then the competition
begins, as follows: "There are under that
paper five blue stones, one big, one smaller, and
three small," said Kim in all haste. "There are four
green stones, and one with a hole in it; there is one
yellow stone that I can see through, and one like a
pipe stem. There are two red stones, and&mdash;and&mdash;give
me time."</p>

<p>But Kim had reached the limit of his powers.
Then came the turn of the native child.</p>

<p>"First are two flawed sapphires, one of two ruttees
and one of four, as I should judge. The four
ruttees sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is one
Turkestan turquoise, plain with green veins, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
there are two inscribed&mdash;one with the name of God
in gilt and the other being cracked across, for it came
out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have not the
five blue stones; four flamed emeralds there are, but
one is drilled in two places, and one is a little
carven."</p>

<p>"Their weight?" said Lurgan Sahib, impassively.</p>

<p>"Three, five, five and four ruttees, as I judge it.
There is one piece of old greenish amber, and a cheap
cut topaz from Europe. There is one ruby of Burma,
one of two ruttees, without a flaw. And there is a
Ballas ruby, flawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved
ivory from China representing a rat sucking an egg;
and there is last&mdash;ah ha! a ball of crystal as big as a
bean set in a gold leaf."</p>

<p>"Kim is mortified at his bad beating, and asks the
secret." The answer is: "By doing it many times
over, till it is done perfectly, for it is worth doing."</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Conscious and accurate sense impressions are
essential for definite knowledge.</b></p>

<p><b>"He who knows and knows that he knows, he is
wise, follow him."</b></p></blockquote>

<h2 class="nobreak">ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION</h2>
</div>

<p>There is no greater heritage which you can give
your child to aid in his mental development, character
building, and success winning than a trained
ability to control his attention and concentration. In
fact, to the degree in which he is able to do this, will
he be able to control himself and later to control
others. The ability to do these two things is a part of
the capacity of every successful man. Every effort
that you will put forth to aid the child in the development
of these faculties will repay you in many
ways.</p>

<p>Attention is the application of the senses to the
subject in mind. Attention controlled and prolonged
is Concentration.</p>

<p>The opposite, absent-mindedness, is simply involuntary
or uncontrolled attention.</p>

<p>The principal aid you can give the child is to teach
him how to induce and control attention and to know
its enemies and how to avoid them. Attention may
be discussed under several different heads, but we
shall confine ourselves to aids in inducing it. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
be led, not compelled or driven by will force. You
may exert all the force you possess to center your
attention upon one object for a prolonged period,
but in spite of all you can do it will soon wander.</p>

<p>It is said that the longest period of time in which
a mind will attend, without rest, to one subject, is a
few seconds. At the end of that time there must
come consciously or unconsciously, a period of relaxation.</p>

<p>William James, the psychologist, says that "doing
work which requires concentration is like driving a
hungry horse along a road lined on both sides with
green grass. If left to himself the horse will stop
to nibble. It is only by continual jerking and urging
that he can be kept moving forward."</p>

<p>"In the same way the mind is inclined to wander.
There must be conscious ability upon the part of the
individual to urge it along and keep it busy at the
task in hand."</p>

<p>The first stimulus to the attention is change. Prof.
James says: "No one can possibly attend consciously
to an object that does not change." A continual
and unvarying sound soon makes no impression,
you become used to it so that your mind no
longer pays any attention to it. A picture may be
very interesting but if you gaze at one object in it
steadily you will soon go to sleep.</p>


<h3>Exercise for Prolonging the Attention</h3>

<p>Take a sheet of paper and draw a heavy square
upon it. Pin this upon the wall in front of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Gaze steadily upon the square and see how long
you can keep your mind upon it. Do this several
times and you can become acquainted with the
period of time during which you can hold your attention
without change. The knowledge of the
length of this cycle can be a guide of how rapidly
to introduce change as a stimulus.</p>

<p>Now gaze at the square again, introducing a
change before your attention has wandered. Look
at the square, then at the different sides, the corners
and the space inside. See it in different colors, see
the square frame of one color and the center of another,
change the combinations. Let the center be
formed of irregular shaped discs of different colors
and see them change places, forming new figures.
See the frame as a picture frame and with imaginary
pictures in it. See the pictures change and the
objects moving. Let it be a moving picture screen
and imagine the pictures moving there.</p>

<p>Let the square be the fence of a farm, set it all
laid out in fields with the buildings, the stock and
all the work that is going on there. While doing
this make a continual change and attend to the different
details of the picture at different times.</p>

<p>Keep up this exercise as long as you can hold your
attention without wandering. Then start again and
try to prolong the period in which you can control
the attention. Let the movement of the conscious
attention be more rapid if necessary to hold it fixed
upon the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Practice with the pictures on the wall and direct
your attention from one detail to another, always
changing before the attention wanders, keeping it
absolutely under your control.</p>

<p>Attention to be perfect must be directed to one
thing at a time. It must be centered and not scattered.
Perfect attention is a rifle, not a shotgun.
You can best stimulate attention by use of one sense
at a time. At the same time see to it that the other
senses are relaxed and at rest.</p>


<h3>Divided Attention</h3>

<p>It is possible to divide the attention but then it
can not be of the highest quality. Try the experiment
of doing a simple problem in arithmetic and
at the same time say a familiar verse, as "Humpty-Dumpty."
Again try to write the lines of "Mary
had a little lamb," while you say aloud the lines of
"Humpty-Dumpty." While you did succeed in doing
the first you do not succeed in doing the second.
This experiment should be tried by all children to
show them the effect of dividing the attention and
of how it may be done when necessary, but only to
a certain degree. The difficulty of the verse and
problem can be accommodated to the age of the
child.</p>

<p>The attention may be divided between two objects
or acts if they call for the use of two different
senses or are different in their order. You can not
divide your attention between two acts of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
order, as two arithmetic problems, one mental and
the other written, or between two operations of the
same sense. You can not listen to two quartets
singing at the same time, but you can attend to one
and smell some flowers at the same time and do
both fairly well. While using one of the senses for
fixed attention train the others to relax.</p>


<h3>The Degree of Attention</h3>

<p>This will depend upon the strength of the stimulus
or force which excites it. The sense of sight is
the strongest of all the senses and therefore can
exert the strongest stimulus, and should be used in
all possible cases. In the exercises with the square
the changes are all visual and they continue the
strongest stimulus.</p>

<p>Another strong stimulus can be induced by the
feelings of either pleasure or displeasure. Happy,
joyful anticipation or fear, horror, or disgust will
arouse the attention.</p>

<p>Familiarity also aids the attention because of the
feelings which it incites. Visual pictures which
contain familiar scenes are better and all changes
introduced should be of familiar ideas in order to
take advantage of this fact.</p>

<p>The more you embrace in the attention the less
penetrating it will be. Do not try to take in the
whole picture or object all the time, but change from
one detail to another, centering the attention on
one at a time and thus building the perfect whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<h3>Arouse Your Interest</h3>

<p>Always become interested in the thing to which
you are striving to direct your attention. Boys have
no difficulty in paying close attention and remembering
the ball score and the batting average of
the players but to ask them to pay as strict attention
to a lecture on an uninteresting subject is asking
the impossible. The compelling element of interest
has been taken away.</p>

<p>This is a great lesson for all parents and teachers;
if the results of fixed attention are to be expected,
the interest must be supplied and maintained, by
natural or imaginary means.</p>


<h3>Expectant Attention</h3>

<p>Prolonged expectancy is a great aid to holding
the attention. The element of curiosity is a great
impelling force in the child and even in adult life.
This can be taken advantage of in prolonging the
attention.</p>

<p>The element of expectancy also affects the results
of attention. The thing you expect is the thing most
easily found. If you wish to aid a friend who is
searching for a lost article you first learn as nearly
as possible just what it looks like, so that you may
know what you are expected to find.</p>

<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;In the following lines count all the 5s.</p>


<div class="aligned-text2">5 0 3 4 2 6 5 7 4 6 7 8 9 8 0 7 6 8 7 5 4 3 5 7 6 5 4 3 7</div>
<div class="aligned-text3">9 3 7 5 8 4 3 2 6 5 7 3 7 4 5 9 6 8 7 0 2 3 4 2 6 5 8 3 4 9 8 5 6 7 2 2 3 0 9 8 6 5 7 4</div>

<p>Notice how readily the other digits pass before your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
eyes in more or less indistinct rows, but the 5s stand
out more clearly. This is caused by your expectancy,
your attention is fixed upon this one digit and
cares nothing for others. Count the 9s and note the
change of expectancy. Use any selected letter in
this paragraph for additional practice.</p>


<h3>Cure for Diverted Attention</h3>

<p>It is not the easiest thing to learn to control and
to prolong the attention, but it is one of the most
important. Great results are never easily accomplished.
Easily diverted attention is a contributing
cause of failure in every undertaking and if allowed
to continue, will become habitual absent-mindedness.
See to it that your child does not acquire this
unfortunate handicap.</p>

<p>The cure for diverted attention is to enter whole-heartedly
and wholly into everything that you do,
no matter how trivial it may be, do not change or
lose your enthusiasm over it until fully completed.
If you discover something more desirable, put it
aside for the time being and attend to the thing
started, until you have finished.</p>

<p>Learn to use better judgment about what you
start, and when started, never change. It is the tendency
to change which you are striving to overcome.</p>

<p>When one thing is finished go directly and enthusiastically
to the next, without hesitation or indecision.
If uncertain, learn to make a decision and
go through with it to the end, and then do the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
things which may have suggested themselves after
starting.</p>


<h3>Parent Is Child's Interpreter</h3>

<p>These are immensely valuable lessons for children.
Younger children, whose habits are more
easily formed can not realize the importance of it
so that the responsibility must rest upon you, the
parents. See to it that right habits are formed and
wrong ones avoided or corrected if they now exist.
They will thank you for it many times in later years.
Repeat any of the exercises given for sense training
and prolong them for development of attention and
concentration.</p>

<p>An unusually successful physician tells how his
mother developed his conscious attention. Each
time she told him to do something or sent him upon
an errand she would require him to repeat to her
just what she had told him to do. If he could not
he had to stand and think it over, and if he had not
paid good attention he was punished.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was given instructions and when he
had left the house was called back and required
to repeat in detail where he was going and what
he was to do and say. By this method he learned
to pay attention and thereby to remember well. In
the practice of his profession he used this idea, requiring
the parent or nurse to repeat his instructions
for the care of the patient and the use of the medicine,
in this way avoiding omissions and improving
the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Follow this plan and help your children to learn
to pay attention and to remember when told once.</p>


<h3>What Is Concentration?</h3>

<p>An uninterrupted continuation of the flow of
thought and undivided attention is concentration.
It is the result of a well-regulated and controlled
thought process. It is accomplished by patient and
persistent effort. It is a reward of the highest value.
There is no real effort connected with it, but you
become so engrossed and interested in your thought
that you are conscious of nothing else. Everything
else is excluded and your whole consciousness is concentered
upon one thought.</p>

<p>One moment's complete concentration will go farther
toward the mastery of a lesson or solution of
your problem than much time spent in idle, disconnected
thought.</p>

<p>This is a faculty not easily mastered, but when
once harnessed and under your control has the greatest
constructive power.</p>


<h3>Exercise for Concentration</h3>

<p>The following exercises are valuable for prolonged
periods of concentration, for developing the
visual faculty, and exercising the productive imagination.
They will prove of great worth to adults
in helping with the construction and definite visualization
of their life ideals and business problems.
By this process you can easily learn to direct con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>centrated
thought power to the bringing about of
your plans and ideals.</p>


<h3>The Construction of a Home</h3>

<p>Visualize a forest, into which some lumbermen
are coming. See them cutting the trees, sawing
them into mill lengths, and donkey engines drawing
them to the railroad. They are loaded and hauled
to the mill, where they are converted into lumber.
See as much detail as you know of the mill processes.</p>

<p>The lumber is loaded on cars, shipped to the city,
unloaded in a lumber yard, sold and hauled to the
spot in the city where a house is to be erected. Follow
the erection of the house, watch all the details
of its construction until fully completed and the occupants
have moved in and established their home.
Furnish the house, each room separately, and arrange
and cultivate the grounds.</p>

<p>This exercise can be continued as far as you desire
to prolong the period of concentration. Add all
possible detail which will depend upon the amount
of knowledge which you possess along these lines.
Some parts of the work you will be able to follow
in detail, others you may know little about. If there
is some other kind of construction that you are more
familiar with you can use it in order to make the
visualization definite.</p>

<p>See to it that your concentration is complete, do
not allow your mind to wander. Keep this picture
moving so as to hold the complete attention, become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
interested in the development of each process. Prolong
the period of concentration as far as possible.</p>

<p>This and the following exercises may be too complicated
for your children, according to their age,
but some of the simpler ones should be begun as
early as eight years. The length and detail increasing
with the ability and knowledge.</p>

<p>Remember that the children should be gathering
knowledge by sensations. Those parts of the former
picture, of the Construction of a Home, with which
they are unfamiliar, should be brought to their attention.
Describing the processes to them is good,
but far better for them to get the original sensations
for themselves. Take them to the forest, to the mill
and lumber yard. Let them go where a house is
being built and spend as much time there as possible.
Parents should be purposefully adding to
their children's stock of knowledge.</p>


<h3>The Farmer and His Farm</h3>

<p>See a settler going into an unsettled country and
beginning the construction of a farm. Watch him
build his cabin, clear the land, break the virgin soil
and put in the crops. See the development of the
home, the well, the fences, barn, sheds, enlargement
of fields, bringing on of stock, the harvesting
of crops, building of greater barns, the new home,
settling of the community. Continue the development
of the farm as much in detail and as far as
you can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Farmer and His Crop</h3>

<p>Visualize the first breaking of the field in the
spring, the preparation of the soil for sowing, bringing
of the seed corn from winter storage, the planting,
cultivating, and growth of the crop. Watch
the ripening, the cutting, shocking, husking, hauling
and storing into barns.</p>

<p>Now follow the corn to the mill and through the
processes of manufacture until it arrives on the
table as corn flakes, syrup or corn bread.</p>

<p>Do this with the other crops. Follow the wheat
until it is bread. The buckwheat to the steaming
hot cakes. The same can be done with the stock
on stock farms. The different kinds of farming can
be used for variety. The great wheat farms present
different pictures from the usual diversified ones.</p>

<p>The fruit orchard presents an interesting picture
to work with. The spraying, the cultivating, irrigating,
and all the process from the blossoming to
the picking, sorting, packing, transportation and
sale.</p>

<p>This same plan can be followed with all industries
and manufacture of any article. Take the ore from
the mine to the steel in the building or battleship.
The oil from the well to gasoline in the auto tank.
The automobile from metal, wood, leather and rubber
to the picnic in the woods.</p>


<h3>The Growing Plant</h3>

<p>To visualize the growth of a seed or plant is interesting
and helpful. Prepare the soil, plant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
seed, see the little hair roots start out from the seed,
the first green sprout, the breaking of the soil, the
gradual growth, the leafing, branching, budding,
and flowering. Hold your mind upon all pictures
which you are visualizing. Direct it consciously, do
not let it wander. Use motion, color, vividness of
detail, everything that will aid concentration.</p>

<p>For this exercise younger children can use the
making of a kite, building of a sand castle or doll
house; a Hallowe'en party; a trip to the woods. Let
him start with the well-known and familiar and
lead him up to the unknown, which will develop a
desire upon his part for more definite knowledge
of the subject.</p>

<p>The chief factor in observation and in acquiring
knowledge is Attention and Concentration. These
can be produced by curiosity and the desire to excel,
which is found in the love of competition and the
game spirit. A good example of concentration is
found in the juggler or acrobat on the vaudeville
stage or in the circus. The ability to concentrate
will grow with the doing of the exercises and playing
games such as are mentioned here.</p>

<p>Any exercises or games which will result in improved
ability to concentrate and pay attention are
valuable. Play the games with the child, use any
method or idea which suggests itself if it gets results.
Give the child a conscious realization of the
possession and value of this power. See to it that
he continues to develop it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE IMAGINATION</h2>
</div>

<p>Even in the simple exercises for the development
of the senses you have been continuously required to
draw upon the child's imagination. Most children
are blessed with a vivid, active imagination and use
it continuously in their play and self-entertainment.
The reason that this wonderful faculty is so useless
to the average adult is largely caused by a misunderstanding
of the faculty on the part of the parent
and perhaps the teacher.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Imagination is the reproduction, in mental
images, of those sensations which have previously
been experienced.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Most children use both reproductive and the productive
imagination easily. There is, however, considerable
difference in the amount of use and benefit
which they derive from it.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Reproductive imagination is reproducing the literal
copy of the sensations.</b></p>

<p><b>Productive imagination is the forming of a
new image made up of elements from previous
images.</b></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>There is natural individuality in imagination and
a difference in method and in inclination to use the
faculty. Some children reproduce vivid images
which are to them real and impressive and by the
use of which they amuse themselves for hours.
Others reproduce indistinct images which have no
attractiveness, are dim, uncertain, and of little value
or consequence.</p>

<p>Do not expect the imagination of two children
necessarily to operate in the same way, and above
all, do not insist upon the same results. If you wish
to know what the difference is in this faculty of
visual reproduction you can use some definite test,
such as the one following.</p>


<h3>Test for Visual Reproduction</h3>

<p>The Preparation&mdash;Take particular care in the arrangement
of the breakfast table in certain known
order, so that you will later be able to know exactly
what was on it and where it stood. Put on the table
some article of distinct color. If there is any question
of your being able to check accurately the arrangement
leave the table as it is for an hour or so
after the meal.</p>

<p>The Test&mdash;Some time after the family have left
the table, not less than an hour and preferably
longer, ask each child separately, and not in the
hearing of the others, how the breakfast table looked
that morning. Let the child tell in detail what he
can of the appearance of the table, or if old enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
let each write a description. The ease with which
this is done, the amount of definiteness displayed,
and the vividness with which the child reproduces
the table will be an accurate indication of the quality
of images used in his imagination.</p>


<h3>A Universally Useful Faculty</h3>

<p>Some have held the notion that imagination is a
faculty useful only to actors, artists or poets. This
is untrue. Some parents have discouraged and even
killed the imaginative faculty in their children, because
they did not wish them to follow either of
the above professions.</p>

<p>Your child will be the greatest credit and satisfaction
to you if he becomes that for which his natural
endowment and inclination is strongest. It is
a great mistake for parents to drive a child to grow
up according to some previously conceived plan or
professional choice of their own. Parental wisdom
and duty are to find out what the child is especially
endowed for and to guide him in taking advantage
of these natural gifts, and at the same time inducing
a general development in other lines.</p>

<p>Because of past misunderstanding or lack of understanding
of its importance in every line of effort,
including science, engineering, and every business
development, many parents have discouraged their
children in the use of their imagination. Every
leader in commercial and industrial life is a man
who has learned to use this faculty. Without it he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
could not make great progress. Other men as brilliant
as he have lagged behind because they have
never cultivated their imagination or allowed themselves
to be led by it. You should do everything
possible to encourage and to guide your children in
the conscious use of this faculty.</p>


<h3>Children's Falsehoods</h3>

<p>Many parents are distressed because of the tendency
on the part of young children to tell untruths,
"stories" about what they have seen or heard. This
tendency is more marked in some children and occurs
in the younger years before the senses and faculties
are thoroughly under control. There is nothing
dangerous about this, it is more often than not
the result of a vivid imagination in which the visualizations
appear real. The fusion of ideas and
illusions sometimes cause the story to be "so awful."</p>

<p>In most cases the child will outgrow this tendency
and if carefully and wisely watched over nothing
detrimental will come of it. It is an indication of
a strong imaginative faculty which, if guided and
trained, will later be of immense value to him. Children
who have a tendency to this "story telling"
should not be punished for it. They should be given
to understand that these are imaginary stories
and should not be told as the truth. They will, of
course, appear real to the child, but he will gradually
learn to distinguish between the real and the
imaginary.</p>

<p>Two children, both with vivid imaginations, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
allowed and encouraged in telling all kinds of imaginary
stories, and playing imaginary games, but
were taught to discriminate between these and the
truth by the use of the word "really." If one began
to wonder if the things the other was telling
were true and actually happened, he would ask,
"Was it really, sister?" "Oh, no, not really," was
the reply, and the game or story proceeded. In this
way the children developed the faculty and were
taught to respect the truth.</p>


<h3>Reality of Illusions</h3>

<p>There may be many individual peculiarities about
your child's imagination and his "story telling inclination,"
but these should not induce you to be
severe or to forbid them unless you have studied
the subject of the imagination carefully, or secured
competent advice.</p>

<p>You attend the entertainment of a magician, and
during the whole evening your senses are deceived.
The magician uses the inclination of the mind to
illusions in making his tricks possible. He throws
a ball into the air a couple of feet and catches it.
Then he throws it higher and does the same several
times, the last time he goes through the same motion
without the ball and nine-tenths of the audience
will swear that they saw it actually disappear in
the air. If we with years of experience in sensation
and thought are so easily deceived can you
justly punish a child for yielding to the same mental
tendencies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>


<h3>Imagination a Curse or Blessing</h3>

<p>All normal children possess the faculty and its
use will bring them blessing and success if properly
guided. The direct opposite is true. If the child is
allowed to form the habit of using his imagination
carelessly and negatively it will be harmful to an
extreme degree.</p>

<p>Positive imagination which suggests happy, cheerful
and successful thoughts and actions should be
praised and encouraged.</p>

<p>Negative imagination which suggests danger, accident,
sickness, loss and failure, should be discouraged
and immediately replaced by thoughts which
are positive in quality. Imagination allowed to
dwell upon morbid, revengeful, ethically forbidden,
or immoral ideas is harmful physically as well as
morally. "He who has imagined an action 'has
committed it in his heart.'"</p>

<blockquote><p><b>There is no greater truth than&mdash;"As a man
thinketh in his heart so is he."</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Imagination is the fountain head of thought and
therefore the source of words, action, personality
and character. Help your child to control the whole
trend of his life by carefully governing the operations
of his imagination.</p>


<h3>Dissipating the Imagination</h3>

<p>Here is a danger point, "Day dreaming, idle flights
of imagination, building air castles are of little value,
and dangerous in that they tend to develop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
habit." If indulged in to excess they constitute a
foolish waste of time. Occasional flights of this
kind should not be dealt with harshly, but any tendency
to persist in them should be stopped.</p>

<p>Reading of books which are wild flights of imagination
often constitute a harmless form of recreation
for persons who are confined for long hours
at routine work, or engaged in hard physical labor.
Children do not need this extreme class of reading
and should not be allowed to indulge in much of it.</p>


<h3>Exercises for the Imagination</h3>

<p>First strive for clearness in the reproduction and
ability to keep the images separate. The reproduction
of letters and figures in the exercises for visualization
on page 46 will accomplish this result.</p>

<p>Problems in mental arithmetic, if visualized, are
of great value in that the correct solving of them
requires vivid and separate images. Work for fullness
of detail, the picture frame suggested on page
74 offers an excellent opportunity to do this while
exercising the constructive imagination. While fixing
the attention upon the square you keep the element
of change going by use of the imagination in
picture making. Put into this picture all the detail
possible, add everything you can think of and then
strive to create still more.</p>


<h3>The Story Games</h3>

<p>Read the child a story or description of some well-known
object, then have him tell it as nearly as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
can reproduce it. Now have him tell it again and
add every bit of detail, every new circumstance and
condition which he can create for himself.</p>

<p>Read half of a story to the child and have him go
on from where you leave off, making his own imaginary
ending for it. Then read the conclusion to
show him how the author's imagination differed
from his.</p>

<p>Most of the exercises and games given for the development
of Visualization and Attention call the
imagination into action. These three faculties are
so closely related that they can not be treated entirely
separate. Any exercise previously given for
the first two will develop the imagination as well.</p>

<p>These faculties of Visualization, Attention and
Imagination combine in the operation of the great
faculty of Memory, which is to be the subject of
the Second Book. Exercises given there will result
in further development of the imagination.</p>


<h3>The Game of Creation</h3>

<p>Prof. Gates is credited with being the first to use
the following idea for guiding the constructive imagination
in producing new ideas. He has in the
past few years used it so effectively that there are
more than one hundred articles now manufactured
under the protection of patents by the United States
Government, and scores of others are being perfected.</p>

<p>Make a list of all the things in the room, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
select one object and combine it with the rest of
the list and see how many new ideas will result.
This is using the constructive imagination, creating
a new whole from familiar parts. Example&mdash;</p>

<p>Floor, table, ceiling, wall, window, glass, casing,
frame, stove, pipe, damper, oilcloth, cover, rug,
boards, paint, plaster, paper, picture, frame, bench,
chair, couch, morris chair, curtain, rod, lace, book,
paper, magazine, Victrola, plant, flag, etc.</p>

<p>Select table, and by combining it with the other
objects we will see how some new combinations
have been created, and perhaps we will create some
ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>Table&mdash;wall, suggests a table disappearing into
the wall, as used in small apartments.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;oilcloth, a common article.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;cover, also common.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;rug, Oriental rugs are often used for table
covers.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;boards, the extension dining table.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;chair, the combination used in dairy
lunches.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;book, the library table.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;Victrola, a combination manufactured by
the Columbia Company.</p>

<p>Table&mdash;flag, suggests the flag as a table cover.</p></blockquote>

<p>The longer the list the greater the possibility of
finding some new and useful idea. Business men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
use this idea constructively. Woolworth combined
the 5c and store, and made his fortune. Ingersol
combined the Dollar and Watch. A boat, paddles,
and a steam engine resulted in the first steamboat.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the illustration, it is everywhere
apparent and in many things that you use.
Every new invention or short-cut in business will
result from a new combination of existing concepts.
We are now manufacturing alcohol from sawdust,
rubber from wheat. When shall we stop?</p>

<p>Play this game with the children. They will enjoy
it and learn how progress has been made and
gain new and valuable ideas. An active lad was
confined to the house with a broken leg. His mother
started him playing this game and by its use he has
discovered many new games. This time it suggested
kite&mdash;window, and soon, with the assistance of a
neighbor boy, he was flying his kite out of a window.</p>


<h3>The Picture Gallery</h3>

<p>In the great home of the mind there is a room of
unusual importance which can be known as the picture
gallery. Here the great artist Imagination
hangs the products of his efforts. Picture after picture
is painted by this wonderful faculty and hung
in this gallery. Each of these pictures becomes a
force exerted upon the individual in whose mind it
is hung. Thought and Desire wander in this gallery
incessantly, and gaze upon the pictures there, using
them as patterns for their efforts in future. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
these pictures they get their incentive and inspiration.</p>

<p>The young child's picture gallery is a wonderful
room with clean, white walls waiting for the artist
to take up the task of painting and hanging the
pictures. This artist is young and inexperienced
and easily influenced and guided by one older and
more accurate.</p>

<p>The parents should realize that this gallery is going
to be rapidly filled with pictures, and that the
choice of these pictures can be almost entirely under
their control. You can help your child's imagination
paint clean, wholesome pictures that will result
in helpful and constructive influence upon his
life. But remember that these pictures ARE BEING
HUNG, whether YOU take time to help in the
work or not.</p>

<p>If the pictures are negative in influence, or
those suggested by wrong companions and vulgar
thoughts, the result will show itself sometime in
the future. The life will sooner or later reproduce
these pictures in personal character and action.</p>

<p>Pictures which are objectionable can be replaced,
or covered over by attractive ones, which will be
helpful and lead Thought into right paths and create
Desire that will be a future blessing. Remember,
it is far more difficult to replace a negative picture
than to paint a helpful one before the other has
made its impression. It is very important that you
place your picture first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Imagination is the architect and his plans are
hung upon the walls of this picture gallery, where
other faculties use them for building the character
and personality of the child. His future circumstances,
success, or failure, will be the result of this
law of nature. The contents of this picture gallery
are great and powerful causes which help bring
about the desired result.</p>

<p>If this truth can be sufficiently impressed upon
the mind of parent and child, both will co-operate
in an effort to hang the right kind of pictures in the
gallery and the result will be a finer and more successful
life.</p>

<p>Every parent should make it a duty to hang in
this gallery beautiful pictures of all the ideals which
they wish to see fulfilled by their child. Besides
the ideals of growth, character, purity, etc., there
should be such pictures as a home; a life of useful
service; financial independence, and a happy old
age. The details are a matter of individual choice
and should be filled in as the years pass by the
growing understanding and ambition of the child.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE POWER OF SUGGESTION</h2>
</div>

<p>Everything that the child experiences exerts an
influence upon his future. It suggests a tendency
to thought or action. Once the thought or act is indulged
in, it has started the formation of habit.
One act will not create a habit, but one act will tend
to induce the child to act again in the same manner
rather than go contrary to it or to vary the method.
Repeated action forms a habit, for habit is defined
as a tendency of the mind to do again what it has
done before.</p>

<p>Habits, of course, vary in their strength, but you
must realize the importance of the fact that the first
repetitions are the important factors, because they
are the habit's beginning. If the child's tendency
is wrong do not delay changing it. Tomorrow may
be too late. There is no certain age at which child
training should begin. It is never too soon. The
earlier you begin the easier it will be, and the more
pleasure and satisfaction you will derive from your
children.</p>

<p>The story is told of an anxious parent who went
with a six-year child to the Bishop. The mother told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
at great length of the difficulty she was having with
the child and asked what the proper age was to
begin training him. The Bishop's reply was: "My
dear woman, you are six years late."</p>

<p>Parents who procrastinate or delay correcting
wrong tendencies and instilling right ones because
"the child is too young to know better," or "it's too
soon to train him yet," will awaken to find that they
have formed a wrong habit and that the child will
soon be trying to train and rule them.</p>

<p>There is no method of child training as helpful as
that of Suggestion. Inducing the child by directly
spoken words to think and believe that he is, and
that he does, what you wish him to be and to do.
This is known as Direct Suggestion. This is the
most difficult form to use, as it may arouse antagonism,
in which case no favorable result will be secured.
It is better to postpone the use of Direct
Suggestion until some time when you can sit down
quietly and talk to the child, holding him in your
lap and first preparing his mind by story or quiet
talk of positive and constructive nature. Then make
the Direct Suggestion in a clear, definite statement.
Do not stop to argue or to impress the suggestion
by moralizing. Prepare the soil of the child's mind,
plant the seed (the Direct Suggestion), cover it
over and leave it to germinate there. You do this
by once clearly stating the ideal and then passing
on to some other talk or story. Do not allow the
child to argue the statement of the Suggestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
This is fatal to its germination. Have him in a passive
mood in which he is listening to all that you
say, and after you have given the Direct Suggestion
and planted the seed, pass on to something else before
he starts a train of contrary thoughts in his
mind.</p>

<p>If he resists and denies your statement before you
can lead his mind on, the soil was not properly prepared.
Do not be discouraged, try again. Never
be discouraged or give up, if you expect to gain results
by the use of Suggestion.</p>

<p>After you have succeeded in planting this seed-thought
in the child's mind, cultivate it. Do not
neglect it, but return to it and emphasize the thought
at another time, and gradually induce him to think
of it in a positive manner. Tell an imaginary story
which depicts the positive side of your seed-thought,
and let him know it is of him you are thinking.</p>

<p>Always be positive&mdash;never negative. Always
state the thing you want as it <b>now</b> is. Make it
present tense&mdash;not even future. In suggestion there
is no place for don't, can't or any other negative
statement. Do not refer to the negative condition
which you are striving to overcome. Do not say,
"Your headache is better." Leave out the headache
and say only, "You are better." A transitory
term as&mdash;is becoming, or a future term as&mdash;you will
be, or a questionable effort as&mdash;try to do, should
not be used. Make your statement always positive,
present tense, and completed. As for example:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
"This is mama's big, strong boy." "My boy always
tells the truth." "My boy is strong and he is always
kind." "John is a gentleman, he is kind to his sister."
"Sarah loves her kitty and is kind and gentle
with it."</p>

<p>The story of the Scotch wife will illustrate the
effect of making negative statements. The husband
was starting off on Saturday night to the village.
John had a weakness, and knowing this the wife
stood on the doorstep calling after him, "John, don't
go near the saloon." "John, don't go near the saloon."
"John, don't go near the saloon." With
the best of intentions she kept repeating this as long
as she could make him hear. John needed help,
but if you will stop to think a moment you will see
that the wife had continuously impressed upon his
mind "the saloon," and, true to her fears, John returned
home at a very late hour and in a sad condition.</p>

<p>Suggestion to be of value must get beyond the
critical and analytical activity of the conscious mind
and become placed in the sub-conscious. If the
conscious mind denies the statement, either audibly
or to itself, the sub-conscious is not influenced. The
most profitable time to plant these positive seed-thoughts
is just before the child "drops off to sleep."</p>

<p>The sub-conscious mind, which is influenced by
the suggestion, never rests. It is the mind which
controls the breathing, heart beat and other "sub-conscious
action" of the body. It is working all
the night through. If you fall asleep thinking in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
happy anticipation of some pleasure tomorrow you
will awaken in the same happy, buoyant condition
of mind. Often you have to think a moment to ascertain
the reason for your happy mental condition,
then you remember, "This is the day of the picnic."
This shows how the sub-conscious has retained all
through the night the thought which was placed
there just before the conscious mind sleeps.</p>

<p>Take advantage of this fact and strive to place a
positive, constructive thought upon the sub-conscious
mind of your child just before sleep. It will
be held and built into character and physical development
all through the night.</p>


<h3>Indirect Suggestion</h3>

<p>This method is usually most effective because it is
applied at times and in a manner which tends to
overcome any tendency to negative influence of the
conscious mind. All have seen the pitifully bashful
child whose mother takes every opportunity to tell
the visitors, <b>in the child's hearing</b>, how bashful she
is. To the child she says: "My, you are the most
bashful child I ever saw." The former statement
made to the visitor, is a negative indirect suggestion;
the latter, the statement to the child, is negative
Direct Suggestion. Both of these tend to increase
the child's bashfulness. They will never
overcome it.</p>


<h3>Indirect Positive Suggestions</h3>

<p>Two parents are sitting in a living room talking;
the child is playing in the next room, or even on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the floor of this one. Without paying any attention
and with the apparent intention of the child not
hearing, the mother, in an undertone, says to the
father: "Have you noticed how improved Sarah is
of late; she is kind and thoughtful of her kitty, she
loves it more and is so kind and gentle with it?"
Father replies: "Isn't that nice; she is a dear, kind,
gentle child." The parents go on talking about
other things not noticing the little girl.</p>

<p>If you were where you could observe you would
see the child stop her play at the mention of her
name, listening intently, and thinking about what
has been said. Most likely she would find her kitty
and come back loving it and demonstrating the result
of mother's suggestion.</p>

<p>This indirect method of sowing seed-thoughts is
most effective, and will correct errors and form
right habits and character, much more rapidly than
correction, argument, or punishment. The possibilities
of the use of suggestions in child training are
limitless. There are many cases where miraculous
results have been secured by intelligent, devoted
mothers.</p>

<p>In the matter of health and overcoming of detrimental
habits there is no greater power than that
of positive Suggestion intelligently used. Every
up-to-date and thoroughly progressive physician
realizes the power of the positive thought over the
human body. During the epidemic of Influenza
which swept through the Army Camps where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
boys were being trained for overseas service, all
the available ministers were called into a large hospital
to minister to the sick and dying. Before being
allowed to go among the sick soldiers they were
gathered together and given a talk by one of the
head surgeons. One of the instructions was this:
In all talking with the sick there must not, under
any circumstances, be any mention or reference to
death, the possibility of death, or of any condition
after death. Every thought and word must be of
health, recovery and what they are going to do after
recovery. This must be followed in conversation,
letter writing for the sick, and in prayer with them.
This is an example of the modern acceptance of the
value of positive suggestion in cases of sickness.</p>

<p>In matters of Child Training it is of the utmost
value. Dr. Stanley Krebbs, in his book, "The Law
of Suggestion," which every parent should read,
tells many interesting examples of its use. "A little
girl had formed the habit of telling lies in order to
attract attention. When this fact was learned it
was made the key of her recovery. It was lodged
in her mind that her lies caused people to avoid
her, to dislike her; but that if she were truthful she
would make people like her, would make friends
and attract a great deal more attention than in any
other way. Simple! but successful."</p>

<p>Quoting again from Dr. Krebbs, "Take an extreme
case, Belford Russell Lawrence, the boy criminal,
testified at twelve years of age, that among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
things, his mother had often said to neighbors, referring
to him: 'That devil will hang yet.'</p>

<p>"As a general rule children are what their elders
expect them to be.</p>

<p>"As a general rule we adults are what our fellows
expect us to be."</p>

<p>The story is told of a boy who was no student and
hated school, he even disliked to read. One time
when there were guests at dinner there arose a discussion
of a certain point of history. The boy had
just studied this fact in school and was able to set
the entire group right. On several occasions later
his mother repeated this fact to friends, in the boy's
hearing, always ending with the statement: "You
know Johnny is quite a historian." Up to that time
he had had no interest in the study, but believing
that others considered him an authority on the subject
he got busy and studied up on it. He afterward
became a historian and a professor in one of
the large universities. He just had to make good,
to keep up with his mother's expectation, and he did.</p>

<p>Take every opportunity to tell others about the
good points of your children and the characteristics
that you want them to have. Do this when the children
can hear you. Tell it to others and the child
will not disappoint you.</p>

<p>The subject should be studied by every parent.
There is no attempt made to cover it in these pages,
but merely to give a hint of its possibilities in the
hope that the parent will learn to use this power
constructively and wisely.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">HEALTH HABITS</h2>
</div>

<p>Habits are a great part of life. The forming of
proper ones should have more attention than is
usually given to them. Habits is a tendency of mind
to do that which it has done before. When considered
in this simple way habit becomes one of the
great forces in our lives. It is by taking advantage
of this fact that we are able to develop rapidity and
efficiency in movement. This shows itself in playing
games or musical instruments and in later life
in the operation of machines in office and factory.</p>

<p>Every child begins to form habits with his first
actions. He has his individual way of dressing,
which is simply the result of having repeated this
method several times. Each repetition adds to the
strength of the habit.</p>

<p>To correct a habit it will be necessary for you to
suggest a new method and see to it that it is repeated
a sufficient number of times to become the
stronger tendency. No habit is or can be formed
without the element of repetition.</p>

<p>Realizing that children are forming habits which
will follow them through life should suggest to the
parent the importance of consciously guiding the
child in their formation. Do not allow careless, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>efficient,
dawdling methods to become fixed. Of
course, these may in later years be changed to more
efficient methods by the child himself, but it will be
at the expense of considerable effort and loss of
time. On the other hand, many children will not
correct the habits and will be handicapped by them
all through life.</p>

<p>There are certain simple regulations of health
that are of vital importance to the life success of
every one and the parent should attend to their
becoming habits while the child is small.</p>

<p>Mental efficiency and accuracy are quickly influenced
by bodily conditions. Poor health or physical
inability are never accompanied with 100%
mental efficiency. You may at once think of some
examples of men of high mental caliber who were
deficient and handicapped by physical disability.
This is sometimes the case, but it is an exception,
and an illustration of success won, in spite of difficulty.
Think of what such an indomitable spirit
could have accomplished in a more perfect physical
body.</p>


<h3>Deep Breathing</h3>

<p>One of the strong influences on health is that of
purifying the blood in the lungs. Plenty of fresh
air is necessary for this purifying, and insufficient
or impure air supply in the lungs will send the blood
back to the heart only partially cleansed.</p>

<p>Teach the child to stand erect, to consider his
position when sitting, and at all times to demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
fresh air. Do not be afraid of an open window, always
have good ventilation, especially in sleeping
rooms. Give the child a simple exercise for deep
breathing and help him to use it until he has formed
the habit of taking several deep breaths of fresh
air immediately upon arising in the morning; each
time he goes out of a building into the open air;
and many times during the day. Singing, running,
skipping, jumping rope, etc., are all good exercises
to stimulate deep breathing. See to it that the
child breathes through the nose.</p>


<h3>Drinking Water</h3>

<p>Many chronic troubles result from the simple
neglect to supply the body with sufficient water. An
average grown person should have two quarts of
water a day and more in warmer weather. The
lack of any habitual time for drinking this water
usually results in not getting it at all. Continued
disregard of the craving of the body for water, because
"it is not convenient to get it" at the time,
will result in the cessation of this natural demand.
Many persons have said, "I don't require that much
water; I never drink but a glass or two." Inquiry
will reveal the fact that these persons are usually
sufferers from constipation or some other chronic
trouble. Drinking a proper amount of water will
cure many cases of constipation.</p>

<p>To be sure that the child gets sufficient water
adopt some systematic time for drinking. A glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
before meals is beneficial to digestion. It stimulates
the flow of the digestive juices. Drinking during
meals is not injurious under one condition, that
is that no water is taken while you have any food
in the mouth. Clear the mouth of food and then
drink, do not wash your food down. Be careful not
to take cold water soon after eating hot food, there
is danger of cracking the enamel of the teeth. A
habit should be formed of drinking a glass of water
when washing in the morning; wash the stomach as
well as the face and hands.</p>

<p>An average meal requires moisture equal to about
five glasses. This is drawn from the system if not
supplied with the meal. A glass of water before
and one after each meal is an aid to digestion rather
than a detriment. Make this a habit. It is a convenient
time to furnish the amount of water required
by the body, and more than the two glasses is better
than less.</p>

<p>If the child is troubled with constipation or an
approach to it see to it that he gets a copious supply
of water and you will find the trouble relieved.</p>


<h3>Rest and Sleep</h3>

<p>As long as you can continue the practice do not
allow the children to get "too old" for an afternoon
rest. Even if he can not sleep, to lie down and relax
will be of very definite value to health and bodily
resistance of disease. If you are encouraging the
cultivation of "the silence" and periods of construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>tive
thought this can be combined with the rest
period.</p>

<p>Rest and relaxation should be synonymous. To
be able to relax thoroughly is of great value in the
strenuous years of later life and should be cultivated
and become habitual when young. In order
that the child's sleep shall be of utmost value teach
him to practice relaxation upon lying down and
always doing so before falling asleep. This, coupled
with a positive mental attitude, will make his sleep
most profitable.</p>

<p>Never allow the child to go to sleep in anger or
fright. Take time to change all negative mental
conditions to positive ones before you leave him.
Unless unavoidable he should not be punished before
retiring. The mental attitude in which he falls
asleep will continue through the night. Experiments
have proven that fear, worry, hate, etc., produce
an actual poison in the blood and it affects the
bodily condition, of course. Blood taken from a
man while in a fit of anger and injected into a rabbit
will kill the rabbit almost immediately. These facts
are not new but they need to be taken more into
consideration in training children.</p>


<h3>Thinking Health</h3>

<p>There is no doubt in anyone's mind in these days
that conditions of mind influence conditions of the
body. Positive and constructive thinking will aid
health. Your study of the subject of suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
shows this to be true and the results are beyond
doubt.</p>

<p>In cases of sickness suggestion will be found of
great help. To suggest that the child will be "better
in the morning"; to suggest that he "is better, he
looks better, he acts better," etc. All these positive
thoughts are helpful. This is a deep subject and
parents should give it some careful thought and
investigation.</p>

<p>In cases of epidemics do not allow the child to
think that he must be taken by it. Suggest the opposite
and induce him to think that he is not going
to be sick, this mixed with a generous amount of
common sense in general health conditions and reasonable
caution will prove helpful to say the least.</p>

<p>All of these subjects together with those of foods
and right eating, which are very important, have
been thoroughly covered by many experts and
should have the careful attention of parents. Use
the best methods possible to improve the child's
physical condition, which will in turn increase his
mental efficiency.</p>

<p>Unusual conditions of mind or body which are not
understood by the parent should not be allowed to
"drift along" or to see if "they may not be outgrown."
Seek the advice of a reputable physician
and save the possibility of regret.</p>

<p>That, "A stitch in time saves nine" is doubly true
of a child's health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<h3>Ambition Pulls</h3>

<p>From his earliest years your child is shaping his
career. What he does today wields a strong influence
on what he will do tomorrow. The sooner you
realize this the better his chances of final success.</p>

<p>Ambition is a great impelling force, encourage its
development in your children. With strong ambition
they can get farther than with greater ability
but lacking in ambition.</p>

<p>A boy sat on a fence holding a kite but not watching
it as boys usually do. A gentleman, in passing,
was attracted to the boy and noticed that he was
blind. This aroused his curiosity as to what pleasure
a blind boy could get flying a kite, so he asked
him: "Do you enjoy flying the kite?" "Yes, sir,"
was the prompt reply. "But you cannot see it."
"No, sir; but say, mister, I can feel 'er pull."</p>

<p>So is ambition, you can't see it, but "you can feel
'er pull."</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
